How much water should I store?     Store at least two gallons of water per person per day, and prepare for a minimum of 3 to 7 days.  For a family of four, this is at least 24 to 56 gallons.  If you have any pets, be sure to store water for them too.  \t\t\t         2.   Is bottled water from the grocery store suitable for storing?     Yes. Bottled water you buy at the grocery store in sealed containers can typically be stored for several years. The bottles should be kept in a cool dark place and should not be exposed to direct sunlight or fumes from petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. You should check the bottles periodically to be sure the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. Replace the bottled water when it reaches the expiration or \u201cuse by\u201d date or if you think the bottles have leaked or lost water due to evaporation.\t\t\t         3.   More Water For Emergencies FAQs    .\t\t\t         4.   Is it safe to store tap water for use during emergencies?     ACWD tap water can be stored safety as long as you take the proper steps to sterilize the storage containers and treat the water before putting it in storage.\t\t\t         5.   What type of container should I use to store the water?     Any clean, airtight container will work, but sturdy, opaque plastic bottles with screw-on caps are preferable. Avoid glass containers that will break easily or paper containers (such as milk cartons) that will weaken over time. Make sure the container has been cleaned with hot, soapy water and rinsed well before filling.\t\t\t         6.   How do I treat the tap water I am planning to store?     Follow the steps below to properly treat the tap water you are storing for emergency use. 1.  Flush the tap for one minute.  This will ensure that any residual metals have been flushed from the home plumbing and that you are getting chlorinated water from the main.   2.  Add \u00bc teaspoon (8 drops) of chlorine bleach for each gallon the container holds. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous. 3.  Fill the container with tap water leaving as little headspace as possible. 4.  Cap the container and tape the lid to keep out dust and dirt. 5.  Place the container in a black garbage bag and close.  This controls dust and prevents algal growth. 6.  Mark the date you filled the bottle on a piece of tape and attach it to the bag. This will allow you to know when it's time to change the water you have stored. The filled water containers should be stored in a cool, dark place and should not be exposed to sunlight or fumes of petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. Remember to check the containers periodically to ensure that the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. If the containers have cracked or are leaking, replace them.            7.   How often should I change my stored water?     To ensure freshness, your emergency drinking water supply should be changed every six months if you are using tap water.\t\t\t         8.   I've used up my emergency water supply. Now what?     Several other sources of drinking water exist in your home. They include:  \u2022   Water drained from your water heater.  \u2022   Water from the flush tank, not bowl, of your toilet. Purify this water before using it.  Do not use chemically treated or \u201cblue\u201d water. \u2022   Melted ice cubes. \u2022   Liquids from canned fruits and vegetables.           9.   ACWD has issued a \"boil water notice.\" What does this mean?    During an emergency, such as a major earthquake, ACWD may issue a \"boil water notice\" until we can verify that the drinking water in our system is not contaminated and is safe to drink. Boiling water before use kills bacteria and other organisms that may be present as a result of damage to ACWD\u2019s water distribution system. During a \"boil water notice,\" any tap water used for drinking or food preparation must be boiled at a full rolling boil for at least one full minute. A full rolling boil is a vigorous boil that cannot be stopped by stirring the water. If the water is very discolored and/or has visible particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before boiling.           10.   Can I purify my water with household bleach?       Boiling water is the preferred method to kill any potential bacteria and other organisms in the water.  However, if the emergency has left you with no way to boil the water or if you have limited fuel and do not want to use it for boiling water, you may treat the water with fresh liquid chlorine laundry bleach. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous.  Also, be aware that liquid bleach loses strength with age. If the water is very dirty looking and/or has particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before treating it. Below is a description of how much liquid bleach to add to each gallon of water: \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to clear water:1/4 teaspoon (8 drops) per gallon \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to cloudy/dirty water:1/2 teaspoon (16 drops) per gallon After you add the bleach, thoroughly mix by stirring or shaking the container. Let the water stand for 30 minutes before using. A slight chlorine odor should be noticeable in the water. If not, add another dosage of bleach and allow the water to stand another 15 minutes before using. The water can also be treated with the use of water purification tablets which can be purchased at most outdoors or sporting goods stores. Follow the directions for use on the package you purchase. Treat only enough water to meet your needs for 48 hours at a time. There is an increased chance of re-contamination if the treated water sits for more than 48 hours. Refrigeration will also help avoid re-contamination. Note: Most home water filters are meant for water that is already micro-biologically safe. Using these filters during a \"boil water notice\" will not guarantee the safety of the water. Replace any filter cartridges after the boil water notice has been lifted to insure your filter is not contaminated.\t\t\t         11.   Are there any other important drinking water guidelines I should follow after a major earthquake?    It's always best to play it safe when it comes to your drinking water following a disaster. Please keep the following \"water-wise\" tips in mind when considering your source and supply of emergency drinking water.   \u2022   Even if you haven't received word of a \"boil water notice\" after a disaster, if your tap water seems cloudy or has an unpleasant odor, purify it before drinking or do not drink it at all.   \u2022   Conserve your drinking water, even if your supply is not interrupted.  Help by shutting off automatic sprinkler systems. \u2022   If plumbing fixtures in your house are damaged and/or leaking, turn off the water supply to your house at the main shut-off valve.  This valve is typically located in a meter box near the sidewalk/street. \u2022   Immediately after a major disaster, consider closing the main household water shut-off valve to isolate your water supply.  This could prevent contamination of internal plumbing and your water heater.   \u2022   If your water service is interrupted, shut off automatic sprinkler systems and turn off the water heater.\t\t\t                       Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

More Water For Emergencies FAQs    .\t\t\t         4.   Is it safe to store tap water for use during emergencies?     ACWD tap water can be stored safety as long as you take the proper steps to sterilize the storage containers and treat the water before putting it in storage.\t\t\t         5.   What type of container should I use to store the water?     Any clean, airtight container will work, but sturdy, opaque plastic bottles with screw-on caps are preferable. Avoid glass containers that will break easily or paper containers (such as milk cartons) that will weaken over time. Make sure the container has been cleaned with hot, soapy water and rinsed well before filling.\t\t\t         6.   How do I treat the tap water I am planning to store?     Follow the steps below to properly treat the tap water you are storing for emergency use. 1.  Flush the tap for one minute.  This will ensure that any residual metals have been flushed from the home plumbing and that you are getting chlorinated water from the main.   2.  Add \u00bc teaspoon (8 drops) of chlorine bleach for each gallon the container holds. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous. 3.  Fill the container with tap water leaving as little headspace as possible. 4.  Cap the container and tape the lid to keep out dust and dirt. 5.  Place the container in a black garbage bag and close.  This controls dust and prevents algal growth. 6.  Mark the date you filled the bottle on a piece of tape and attach it to the bag. This will allow you to know when it's time to change the water you have stored. The filled water containers should be stored in a cool, dark place and should not be exposed to sunlight or fumes of petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. Remember to check the containers periodically to ensure that the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. If the containers have cracked or are leaking, replace them.            7.   How often should I change my stored water?     To ensure freshness, your emergency drinking water supply should be changed every six months if you are using tap water.\t\t\t         8.   I've used up my emergency water supply. Now what?     Several other sources of drinking water exist in your home. They include:  \u2022   Water drained from your water heater.  \u2022   Water from the flush tank, not bowl, of your toilet. Purify this water before using it.  Do not use chemically treated or \u201cblue\u201d water. \u2022   Melted ice cubes. \u2022   Liquids from canned fruits and vegetables.           9.   ACWD has issued a \"boil water notice.\" What does this mean?    During an emergency, such as a major earthquake, ACWD may issue a \"boil water notice\" until we can verify that the drinking water in our system is not contaminated and is safe to drink. Boiling water before use kills bacteria and other organisms that may be present as a result of damage to ACWD\u2019s water distribution system. During a \"boil water notice,\" any tap water used for drinking or food preparation must be boiled at a full rolling boil for at least one full minute. A full rolling boil is a vigorous boil that cannot be stopped by stirring the water. If the water is very discolored and/or has visible particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before boiling.           10.   Can I purify my water with household bleach?       Boiling water is the preferred method to kill any potential bacteria and other organisms in the water.  However, if the emergency has left you with no way to boil the water or if you have limited fuel and do not want to use it for boiling water, you may treat the water with fresh liquid chlorine laundry bleach. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous.  Also, be aware that liquid bleach loses strength with age. If the water is very dirty looking and/or has particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before treating it. Below is a description of how much liquid bleach to add to each gallon of water: \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to clear water:1/4 teaspoon (8 drops) per gallon \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to cloudy/dirty water:1/2 teaspoon (16 drops) per gallon After you add the bleach, thoroughly mix by stirring or shaking the container. Let the water stand for 30 minutes before using. A slight chlorine odor should be noticeable in the water. If not, add another dosage of bleach and allow the water to stand another 15 minutes before using. The water can also be treated with the use of water purification tablets which can be purchased at most outdoors or sporting goods stores. Follow the directions for use on the package you purchase. Treat only enough water to meet your needs for 48 hours at a time. There is an increased chance of re-contamination if the treated water sits for more than 48 hours. Refrigeration will also help avoid re-contamination. Note: Most home water filters are meant for water that is already micro-biologically safe. Using these filters during a \"boil water notice\" will not guarantee the safety of the water. Replace any filter cartridges after the boil water notice has been lifted to insure your filter is not contaminated.\t\t\t         11.   Are there any other important drinking water guidelines I should follow after a major earthquake?    It's always best to play it safe when it comes to your drinking water following a disaster. Please keep the following \"water-wise\" tips in mind when considering your source and supply of emergency drinking water.   \u2022   Even if you haven't received word of a \"boil water notice\" after a disaster, if your tap water seems cloudy or has an unpleasant odor, purify it before drinking or do not drink it at all.   \u2022   Conserve your drinking water, even if your supply is not interrupted.  Help by shutting off automatic sprinkler systems. \u2022   If plumbing fixtures in your house are damaged and/or leaking, turn off the water supply to your house at the main shut-off valve.  This valve is typically located in a meter box near the sidewalk/street. \u2022   Immediately after a major disaster, consider closing the main household water shut-off valve to isolate your water supply.  This could prevent contamination of internal plumbing and your water heater.   \u2022   If your water service is interrupted, shut off automatic sprinkler systems and turn off the water heater.\t\t\t                       Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

How much water should I store?     Store at least two gallons of water per person per day, and prepare for a minimum of 3 to 7 days.  For a family of four, this is at least 24 to 56 gallons.  If you have any pets, be sure to store water for them too.  \t\t\t         2.   Is bottled water from the grocery store suitable for storing?     Yes. Bottled water you buy at the grocery store in sealed containers can typically be stored for several years. The bottles should be kept in a cool dark place and should not be exposed to direct sunlight or fumes from petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. You should check the bottles periodically to be sure the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks.

Make sure the container has been cleaned with hot, soapy water and rinsed well before filling.\t\t\t         6.   How do I treat the tap water I am planning to store?     Follow the steps below to properly treat the tap water you are storing for emergency use. 1.  Flush the tap for one minute.  This will ensure that any residual metals have been flushed from the home plumbing and that you are getting chlorinated water from the main.   2.  Add \u00bc teaspoon (8 drops) of chlorine bleach for each gallon the container holds. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous. 3.  Fill the container with tap water leaving as little headspace as possible. 4.  Cap the container and tape the lid to keep out dust and dirt. 5.  Place the container in a black garbage bag and close.  This controls dust and prevents algal growth. 6.  Mark the date you filled the bottle on a piece of tape and attach it to the bag. This will allow you to know when it's time to change the water you have stored. The filled water containers should be stored in a cool, dark place and should not be exposed to sunlight or fumes of petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. Remember to check the containers periodically to ensure that the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. If the containers have cracked or are leaking, replace them.            7.   How often should I change my stored water?     To ensure freshness, your emergency drinking water supply should be changed every six months if you are using tap water.\t\t\t         8.   I've used up my emergency water supply. Now what?     Several other sources of drinking water exist in your home. They include:  \u2022   Water drained from your water heater.  \u2022   Water from the flush tank, not bowl, of your toilet. Purify this water before using it.  Do not use chemically treated or \u201cblue\u201d water. \u2022   Melted ice cubes. \u2022   Liquids from canned fruits and vegetables.           9.   ACWD has issued a \"boil water notice.\" What does this mean?    During an emergency, such as a major earthquake, ACWD may issue a \"boil water notice\" until we can verify that the drinking water in our system is not contaminated and is safe to drink. Boiling water before use kills bacteria and other organisms that may be present as a result of damage to ACWD\u2019s water distribution system. During a \"boil water notice,\" any tap water used for drinking or food preparation must be boiled at a full rolling boil for at least one full minute. A full rolling boil is a vigorous boil that cannot be stopped by stirring the water. If the water is very discolored and/or has visible particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before boiling.           10.   Can I purify my water with household bleach?       Boiling water is the preferred method to kill any potential bacteria and other organisms in the water.  However, if the emergency has left you with no way to boil the water or if you have limited fuel and do not want to use it for boiling water, you may treat the water with fresh liquid chlorine laundry bleach. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous.  Also, be aware that liquid bleach loses strength with age. If the water is very dirty looking and/or has particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before treating it. Below is a description of how much liquid bleach to add to each gallon of water: \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to clear water:1/4 teaspoon (8 drops) per gallon \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to cloudy/dirty water:1/2 teaspoon (16 drops) per gallon After you add the bleach, thoroughly mix by stirring or shaking the container. Let the water stand for 30 minutes before using. A slight chlorine odor should be noticeable in the water. If not, add another dosage of bleach and allow the water to stand another 15 minutes before using. The water can also be treated with the use of water purification tablets which can be purchased at most outdoors or sporting goods stores. Follow the directions for use on the package you purchase. Treat only enough water to meet your needs for 48 hours at a time. There is an increased chance of re-contamination if the treated water sits for more than 48 hours. Refrigeration will also help avoid re-contamination. Note: Most home water filters are meant for water that is already micro-biologically safe. Using these filters during a \"boil water notice\" will not guarantee the safety of the water. Replace any filter cartridges after the boil water notice has been lifted to insure your filter is not contaminated.\t\t\t         11.   Are there any other important drinking water guidelines I should follow after a major earthquake?    It's always best to play it safe when it comes to your drinking water following a disaster. Please keep the following \"water-wise\" tips in mind when considering your source and supply of emergency drinking water.   \u2022   Even if you haven't received word of a \"boil water notice\" after a disaster, if your tap water seems cloudy or has an unpleasant odor, purify it before drinking or do not drink it at all.   \u2022   Conserve your drinking water, even if your supply is not interrupted.  Help by shutting off automatic sprinkler systems. \u2022   If plumbing fixtures in your house are damaged and/or leaking, turn off the water supply to your house at the main shut-off valve.  This valve is typically located in a meter box near the sidewalk/street. \u2022   Immediately after a major disaster, consider closing the main household water shut-off valve to isolate your water supply.  This could prevent contamination of internal plumbing and your water heater.   \u2022   If your water service is interrupted, shut off automatic sprinkler systems and turn off the water heater.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.                 \u25bc  Customers - Customer Service\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?

What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.  The District charges fees for these and other services so the applicable party pays for these costs instead of the general District ratepayer.  While many District fees are designed to recover the full cost the activity, the new $20 field charges for door tags and shutoff are less than the District\u2019s full cost.  Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?     The Alameda County Water District has a long-term financial obligation as a member of the State Water Project and collects a portion of its state water costs on the property tax bill. The amounts collected are adjusted each year based on the District\u2019s state water costs. The State Water Project provides about 40% of the District\u2019s water supply in a typical year.

Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?

(If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t               \u25bc  Customers - Customer Service\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?

What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.           4.   What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.

How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.           4.   What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.  The District charges fees for these and other services so the applicable party pays for these costs instead of the general District ratepayer.  While many District fees are designed to recover the full cost the activity, the new $20 field charges for door tags and shutoff are less than the District\u2019s full cost.  Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?     The Alameda County Water District has a long-term financial obligation as a member of the State Water Project and collects a portion of its state water costs on the property tax bill. The amounts collected are adjusted each year based on the District\u2019s state water costs. The State Water Project provides about 40% of the District\u2019s water supply in a typical year.

These activities can increase the velocity and change the flow direction that water travels through water mains. Sediments lying on the bottom of the mains may get stirred up, resulting in discolored water. \u00a0 Since 1999, ACWD has maintained an annual main cleaning program designed to remove these sediments on a routine basis. \u00a0During periods of drought, as the region experienced in the past few years, ACWD modifies its annual main cleaning program to conserve water. When this program is modified or postponed, as was done in 2022 and 2023, the adjustment causes higher-than-normal amounts of sediment to accumulate on the bottom of the water mains, such that when stirred up, it causes discolored water.\u00a0 ACWD has rescinded its drought ordinance and will resume the regular main cleaning program in the winter of 2024. \u00a0Customers may continue to experience discolored water episodes when conditions mentioned above occur in the water distribution system. \u00a0Please visit the  Discolored Water FAQs  to learn about discolored water and what to do if your drinking water becomes discolored.\u00a0 Despite its appearance, discolored water does not indicate that the integrity of the water main has been compromised. A disinfectant residual is always maintained to ensure that the water continues to meet all state and federal health-based Drinking Water Standards. Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population such as immunocompromised persons, some elderly, and infants. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. \u00a0 \u00a0 In the meantime, ACWD customers may notice a slight discoloration in the drinking water caused by minute levels of the manganese mineral, making the water appear a light yellowish/brownish color. The discolored water is an aesthetic issue and not due to any failure of the water treatment processes. \u00a0 If you would like to learn more about discolored water or have any concerns, please visit our  Discolored Water FAQs , or call us at 510-668-6500.

These activities can increase the velocity and change the flow direction that water travels through water mains. Sediments lying on the bottom of the mains may get stirred up, resulting in discolored water. \u00a0 Since 1999, ACWD has maintained an annual main cleaning program designed to remove these sediments on a routine basis. \u00a0During periods of drought, as the region experienced in the past few years, ACWD modifies its annual main cleaning program to conserve water. When this program is modified or postponed, as was done in 2022 and 2023, the adjustment causes higher-than-normal amounts of sediment to accumulate on the bottom of the water mains, such that when stirred up, it causes discolored water.\u00a0 ACWD has rescinded its drought ordinance and will resume the regular main cleaning program in the winter of 2024. \u00a0Customers may continue to experience discolored water episodes when conditions mentioned above occur in the water distribution system. \u00a0Please visit the  Discolored Water FAQs  to learn about discolored water and what to do if your drinking water becomes discolored.\u00a0 Despite its appearance, discolored water does not indicate that the integrity of the water main has been compromised. A disinfectant residual is always maintained to ensure that the water continues to meet all state and federal health-based Drinking Water Standards. Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population such as immunocompromised persons, some elderly, and infants. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. \u00a0 \u00a0 In the meantime, ACWD customers may notice a slight discoloration in the drinking water caused by minute levels of the manganese mineral, making the water appear a light yellowish/brownish color. The discolored water is an aesthetic issue and not due to any failure of the water treatment processes. \u00a0 If you would like to learn more about discolored water or have any concerns, please visit our  Discolored Water FAQs , or call us at 510-668-6500.

Algae are microscopic plants that thrive at certain times of the year in rivers and reservoirs. \u00a0The algae is removed from the water in the treatment process, but tiny amounts of compounds can remain behind and cause odors described as \u201cearthy\u201d or \u201cmusty.\u201d   There is no health hazard presented by this phenomenon. The water remains safe to drink, cook with and for all other uses.   ACWD is taking immediate steps to address this issue and we expect the problem to clear up in a few days. We are adjusting our water treatment and production processes, including increased ozone treatment. We believe this ozonation process will minimize the unusual tastes and odors some customers have noticed.   Although we don't know how long the conditions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta may persist, we are working with the California Department of Water Resources, the which operates the State Water Project, as well as neighboring water agencies to monitor and manage this source water issue.

Every governmental agency needs to have a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan approved by CalOES and FEMA in order to be eligible for certain types of pre- and post-disaster grant funding. Without the plan, we cannot\u00a0apply for pre-disaster grant funding that would assist with infrastructure improvements. In addition, the district would not qualify for post-disaster recovery reimbursement. The contents of the plan will have a direct effect on your water district and how it prepares, responds, and recovers from a hazardous event.     The draft plan is available for public review and comment until December 26, 2016.

Just as we\u2019ve prepared, we encourage you to plan ahead and have provided some tools to get you earthquake-ready.  When a major earthquake hits the Bay Area people may be left without water, food, or electricity.  Proper storage of emergency water is crucial to survival and planning ahead will better prepare you and your family. And even with extensive investments to upgrade our water mains, a large quake will damage water mains.  We recommend you store 2 gallons of water per person to use over the course of a week during a disaster. Get the information you need to be prepared and plan ahead. Also be sure to review the Family Disaster Planning Worksheet to assist in creating an emergency supply kit and action plan.

These three sources include water that is diverted from the Alameda Creek Watershed, water purchased from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), and water purchased from California\u2019s State Water Project.   In an average year, 40% of ACWD\u2019s water supply comes from the Alameda Creek Watershed, 40% from the State Water Project, and 20% from the SFPUC.   ACWD\u2019s local water supply from Alameda Creek has benefitted greatly from the series of rain events this winter.  With local rainfall measuring 117% of normal as of Feb 3, these rain events provided enough water to enable ACWD to fill recharge ponds, and make dramatic improvements in local groundwater levels.  These storms, coupled with ACWD customers excellent conservation practices, have allowed both groundwater and lake levels to fill to targeted storage levels for use in 2016. Since these storage target goals have been met, far less water needs to be diverted to recharge ponds, and customers may notice additional flow in Alameda Creek in the coming winter months.   Although local supplies have reached targeted storage levels, statewide supplies remain challenged. Storage reservoirs around the state of California remain well below normal for this time of year.  ACWD continues to work to optimize usage of these water supplies to ensure there is enough water to deliver to customers during this historic drought. We ask that you continue to conserve water as statewide mandatory water use restrictions remain in effect.
