ACWD monitoring wells will be pumped so that groundwater samples can be collected and tested for water quality parameters. This work is necessary because groundwater is a critical source of water that makes up 30 to 60 percent of ACWD\u2019s total water supply. As part of the sampling protocol, a limited amount of groundwater must be removed from the wells and discharged to nearby storm drains. As a result, you may notice water temporarily flowing in the gutters near the sampling sites. ACWD staff have evaluated possible ways of recapturing or reusing the well water removed.  Unfortunately, in most cases, it is not cost effective or technically feasible to do so.

ACWD monitoring wells will be pumped so that groundwater samples can be collected and tested for water quality parameters. This work is necessary because groundwater is a critical source of water that makes up 30 to 60 percent of ACWD\u2019s total water supply. As part of the sampling protocol, a limited amount of groundwater must be removed from the wells and discharged to nearby storm drains. As a result, you may notice water temporarily flowing in the gutters near the sampling sites. ACWD staff have evaluated possible ways of recapturing or reusing the well water removed.  Unfortunately, in most cases, it is not cost effective or technically feasible to do so.  Alternatively, ACWD has taken additional steps to reduce the total amount of water pumped and discharged to better conserve our limited water resources during this time of drought.   Monitoring our groundwater basin is key to protecting our groundwater resources and achieving our mission of providing a reliable supply of high quality water to our customers.

We hope to correct this problem and reduce the possibility of future discolored water episodes by cleaning selected water mains from February 25 - March 11.  In the meantime, we want you to know that your water remains safe to drink and continues to meet all state and federal water quality standards. This discoloration is caused by manganese which is a naturally-occurring mineral in raw water supplies.  Manganese concentrations can vary seasonally and we are currently experiencing higher levels than normal.  This can cause the yellowish tinge. While increased manganese levels may cause your water to look slightly yellow, other events, such as a broken fire hydrant or water main cleaning may temporarily cause a brownish-black discoloration.  If you notice such discoloration, please contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.

What is AMI technology?     The Alameda County Water District (ACWD) is investing in the future of our community by installing Advanced Metering Infrastructure, more commonly known as AMI. This new technology allows water meters to be read remotely for faster leak detection, an increase in customers\u2019 ability to monitor, analyze, and compare consumption data from our user-friendly  My Smart Water Connect  web portal, and creates an overall improved customer experience.           2.   What are the benefits of AMI for me?     AMI allows water meters to be read remotely so customers can: \u2022 Detect potential leaks early \u2022 Reduce surprise water bills \u2022 View up-to-date water usage This new tool supports customers\u2019 water efficiency efforts and reduces the agency\u2019s carbon footprint with fewer trucks on the road since water meters will soon be read remotely instead of manually once every two months. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.\u00a0           3.   What does the AMI project mean for me?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. Here\u2019s what you should know about the installation process: \u2022 Notifications:\u00a0 You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance. \u00a0You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u25cb First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u25cb Second Notice:  Once the work is completed We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter. \u2022 Our Installation Team:\u00a0 ACWD has partnered with Badger Meter and Professional Meters Inc. (PMI) to perform these upgrades. You will recognize them because of their neon green ACWD/PMI uniforms and photo ID badges. Installers will also carry a letter to authenticate their work on the project. \u2022\u00a0 CDC Guidelines Followed:\u00a0 The installers are following all federal, state, and county local, state and CDC guidelines as well as local regulations, and we ask our customers to please do the same.The installers are following local, state, and CDC guidelines by performing daily health screenings, maintaining social distancing, and wearing proper personal protective equipment, that includes face masks, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Clear a Path:\u00a0 Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time. If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access.Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Temporary Water Stoppage:\u00a0 During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time. No one\u2019s water will be shut off for more than an hour unless otherwise communicated. Water at your residence will be temporarily turned off \u2014 for no more than one hour unless otherwise communicated \u2014 for the installation of the AMI device. No further action is required from you.\u00a0 \u2022 Flush Out Your Pipes Post-Upgrade :\u00a0 Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration. Your water remains safe and meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. Please run cold water from a fixture without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water and use it for watering plants.           4.   I received a letter in the mail about this project. What does it mean?

I received a visual, two-sided fact sheet about the project. What does it mean?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024.

Why does ACWD need to upgrade my current water meter?     In order to bring you these new AMI services and capabilities, your current water meter will need to be upgraded to one that it is AMI compatible. Many of the meters we have in service now are nearing the end of their useful life and will need to be replaced in the coming years anyway. By replacing them with AMI compatible meters, we can enhance current customer service offerings and make available new and enhanced services like leak alerts, timely usage measurements and usage alerts to reduce surprise water bills.           8.   Why is ACWD doing this AMI Project now?     The implementation of AMI technology will help the District continue to improve the cost-effectiveness and value of District services. Additionally, ACWD is committed to outstanding customer service and promoting open communication with our customers, and AMI technology will further improve our ability to do just that. The District also has a long-standing commitment to stewardship of water resources and the environment, and AMI technology will also advance that tradition by further reducing the environmental impacts of our operations. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability \u00a0 for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           9.   When will my water meter be upgraded? How will I know?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. A map of the AMI deployment progress providing an estimated timeframe for when your location will be upgrade to AMI technology is located at our user-friendly  My Smart Water Connect  web portal. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is complete We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           10.   How can I prepare for my upgrade?     \u2022\u00a0 Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access. \u2022\u00a0 Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time. If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). \u00a0\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Your water service will be temporarily turned off \u2014 for no more than one hour unless otherwise communicated \u2014 for the installation of the AMI device. If you have a water-dependent device, such as a recirculation pump, you will need to turn it off before your upgrade to avoid possible damage.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 If you have tenants associated with this billing address, please notify them.           11.   I have a smart home water monitoring device attached to my water meter. What should I do? Is it the same as a new AMI meter?     A smart home water monitoring device is a great tool and can typically record water use at 1-minute intervals and be seen in real time in an app. The new AMI meter upgrade you will receive monitors use at 15-minute intervals and data is available the next day in the ACWD My Smart Water Connect customer portal and mobile app. This is the main difference between the two devices. However, as of now, some smart home water monitoring devices, such as the Flume, are not compatible with the ultra-sonic meters that ACWD is installing as part of the AMI upgrade. \u00a0You will need to remove your smart home water monitoring device prior to the AMI upgrade. You will receive a door hanger within 10 working days before the installers arrive to upgrade the meter. If you do not remove your smart home water monitoring device beforehand, ACWD\u2019s contractor will leave a door hanger indicating they cannot access the meter and request that you call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521 to let our installation partners know when the device has been removed.           12.   Will I need to do anything to sign up to receive my AMI meter upgrade?     No. You will be notified before and after the AMI meter is installed, but you don\u2019t need to sign-up to receive the new meter. However, we do ask that once you receive a letter in the mail informing you about the installation that you keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time.           13.   Can I make an appointment for the upgrade?     If you require planned water disruption, or any further assistance, please call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521. \u00a0 \u00a0            14.   After my meter was upgraded/replaced, my water was discolored. Is it still safe?     Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration. Your water remains safe and meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. Please run cold water from a fixture without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water and use it for watering plants.           15.   Have other water districts implemented AMI?     Locally, Dublin San Ramon Services District, City of Pleasanton, City of Hayward, San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and many others have adopted AMI technology in recent years. Hundreds of utility districts across North America have adopted AMI technology for their meter infrastructure needs. This technology has been approved for use in California since 2006 and has become the standard for water meter reading technology.           16.   Is there a cost associated with these AMI improvements?     There is no additional cost to customers for upgrading our meters. The AMI improvements have been fully budgeted in the District\u2019s long term financial plan. Furthermore, because meters that can be read remotely greatly reduce vehicle and other expenses, the District expects the AMI improvements to save money over the long term. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           17.   Will my information be secure?        Yes. Preserving the security of our customers\u2019 data and personal information is one of ACWD\u2019s top priorities. The AMI system will feature advanced encryption technologies that will keep your data safe.           18.   Is AMI technology safe?      Yes. As your neighbor, ACWD takes great pride in providing safe drinking water to the communities we serve. The District would never undertake a project that could be harmful to the health or privacy of the members of our community and we will do everything in our power to ensure that this project is no different.           19.   Is AMI technology a wise investment?      Yes. The District has evaluated AMI and found that the return on investment will save money for the District over time while also enhancing the value and customer service the District provides. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           20.   Will the AMI technology attach to the current manually read meter or will it be placed somewhere else on residents\u2019 property?     Many of our meters are approaching the end of life and are not AMI compatible, so we will be upgrading the meters at these locations. The AMI device will attach to the meter in the meter box and be mounted to the underside of a new lid that will be installed as part of the meter replacement project.           21.   How does the new AMI technology work, and how will the meters be read?     The AMI technology employs a device that utilizes the cellular network, just like your mobile phone and also found in televisions and wireless home phones. This technology allows meters to be read remotely giving customers daily access to their water consumption data. Not only do the AMI device\u2019s radio frequency (RF) waves fall below the level of what is recommended by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), they are also less powerful than any mobile phone. Additionally, the AMI technology inside your water meter is located outside your house, which reduces contact with the RF waves.           22.   How will we be able to recognize the AMI technology installers? Will they be wearing ACWD uniforms?     ACWD has partnered with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI has successfully installed more than 1 million integrated meters, just like the ones you will be receiving, and are highly skilled at the installation process. The PMI installation team will carry a letter for our customers that will explain their work on the new meters. The PMI and ACWD Advanced Meter logos will be on their uniforms, badges, and on their trucks. You will be able to recognize the PMI installation team, as they will wear a distinct uniform that includes a: \u00a0Neon green T-shirt with the PMI logo and the ACWD Advanced Metering logo \u00a0PMI badge displaying the ACWD Advanced Metering logo and including Their name; Photo; Issue Date; And a number to call to confirm their identity.           23.   Will ACWD be hiring installers locally?     ACWD is partnering with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc. (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI will hire up to 30 Bay Area-based installers for this project, bringing jobs to the region. Customers will recognize them because of their neon green uniforms and trucks with PMI/ACWD logos. Installers will also carry a photo ID badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project. The installers are following all federal, state, and county local, state and CDC guidelines as well as local regulations, and we ask our customers to please do the same.           24.   How long will the installation take?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time. No one\u2019s water will be shut off for more than an hour unless otherwise communicated.           25.   When will I be notified about when the installers will upgrade my meter?     You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance. You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is completed We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           26.   There is someone else that has come to check my newly upgraded or replaced AMI compatible water meter, but they are not from Badger Meter or Professional Meters Inc. (PMI). Who are they?     You may also see one of our quality control technicians during or after installation. We\u2019ve partnered with Utility Partners of America UPA) to inspect our installation and ensure it meets our standards. Like installers, the quality control technician will carry a badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project.           27.   I received a notice of a pre-existing customer leak. What does this mean? Why wasn\u2019t my meter installed?     Your AMI meter could not be installed due to a pre-existing customer plumbing leak. As it was found to be customer side, it is your responsibility to fix the leak before installation can take place. ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors adopted an Ordinance Prohibiting Wasteful Use of Water, ORDINANCE NO. 2008-01 (Ordinance) which was adopted by ACWD\u2019s Board to conserve the District\u2019s water supply and eliminate the wasteful use of water, especially critical due to the drought. Under this Ordinance leaks are required to be repaired as soon as possible. ACWD can invoke the enforcement process under this Ordinance for non-compliance with the Ordinance. Once the leak has been fixed and you are ready for installation, please call our Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521.           28.   What if my question is not answered here?     More information, including meeting details and how to take our survey, can be found at ACWD.ORG/AMI. \u00a0The AMI Project Team provided a Virtual Community Informational Meeting on November 16, 2021. \u00a0In case you weren't able to join us, but are interested in learning more:\u00a0 \u00ad\u00adHere's the link to the\u00a0 Presentation Material .

What are the benefits of AMI for me?     AMI allows water meters to be read remotely so customers can: \u2022 Detect potential leaks early \u2022 Reduce surprise water bills \u2022 View up-to-date water usage This new tool supports customers\u2019 water efficiency efforts and reduces the agency\u2019s carbon footprint with fewer trucks on the road since water meters will soon be read remotely instead of manually once every two months. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.\u00a0           3.   What does the AMI project mean for me?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. Here\u2019s what you should know about the installation process: \u2022 Notifications:\u00a0 You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance. \u00a0You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u25cb First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u25cb Second Notice:  Once the work is completed We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter. \u2022 Our Installation Team:\u00a0 ACWD has partnered with Badger Meter and Professional Meters Inc. (PMI) to perform these upgrades. You will recognize them because of their neon green ACWD/PMI uniforms and photo ID badges. Installers will also carry a letter to authenticate their work on the project. \u2022\u00a0 CDC Guidelines Followed:\u00a0 The installers are following all federal, state, and county local, state and CDC guidelines as well as local regulations, and we ask our customers to please do the same.The installers are following local, state, and CDC guidelines by performing daily health screenings, maintaining social distancing, and wearing proper personal protective equipment, that includes face masks, to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Clear a Path:\u00a0 Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time. If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access.Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Temporary Water Stoppage:\u00a0 During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time. No one\u2019s water will be shut off for more than an hour unless otherwise communicated. Water at your residence will be temporarily turned off \u2014 for no more than one hour unless otherwise communicated \u2014 for the installation of the AMI device. No further action is required from you.\u00a0 \u2022 Flush Out Your Pipes Post-Upgrade :\u00a0 Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration.

Please run cold water from a fixture without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water and use it for watering plants.           7.   Why does ACWD need to upgrade my current water meter?     In order to bring you these new AMI services and capabilities, your current water meter will need to be upgraded to one that it is AMI compatible. Many of the meters we have in service now are nearing the end of their useful life and will need to be replaced in the coming years anyway. By replacing them with AMI compatible meters, we can enhance current customer service offerings and make available new and enhanced services like leak alerts, timely usage measurements and usage alerts to reduce surprise water bills.           8.   Why is ACWD doing this AMI Project now?     The implementation of AMI technology will help the District continue to improve the cost-effectiveness and value of District services. Additionally, ACWD is committed to outstanding customer service and promoting open communication with our customers, and AMI technology will further improve our ability to do just that. The District also has a long-standing commitment to stewardship of water resources and the environment, and AMI technology will also advance that tradition by further reducing the environmental impacts of our operations. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability \u00a0 for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           9.   When will my water meter be upgraded? How will I know?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. A map of the AMI deployment progress providing an estimated timeframe for when your location will be upgrade to AMI technology is located at our user-friendly  My Smart Water Connect  web portal. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is complete We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           10.   How can I prepare for my upgrade?     \u2022\u00a0 Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access. \u2022\u00a0 Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time. If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). \u00a0\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Your water service will be temporarily turned off \u2014 for no more than one hour unless otherwise communicated \u2014 for the installation of the AMI device. If you have a water-dependent device, such as a recirculation pump, you will need to turn it off before your upgrade to avoid possible damage.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 If you have tenants associated with this billing address, please notify them.           11.   I have a smart home water monitoring device attached to my water meter. What should I do? Is it the same as a new AMI meter?     A smart home water monitoring device is a great tool and can typically record water use at 1-minute intervals and be seen in real time in an app. The new AMI meter upgrade you will receive monitors use at 15-minute intervals and data is available the next day in the ACWD My Smart Water Connect customer portal and mobile app. This is the main difference between the two devices. However, as of now, some smart home water monitoring devices, such as the Flume, are not compatible with the ultra-sonic meters that ACWD is installing as part of the AMI upgrade. \u00a0You will need to remove your smart home water monitoring device prior to the AMI upgrade. You will receive a door hanger within 10 working days before the installers arrive to upgrade the meter. If you do not remove your smart home water monitoring device beforehand, ACWD\u2019s contractor will leave a door hanger indicating they cannot access the meter and request that you call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521 to let our installation partners know when the device has been removed.           12.   Will I need to do anything to sign up to receive my AMI meter upgrade?     No. You will be notified before and after the AMI meter is installed, but you don\u2019t need to sign-up to receive the new meter. However, we do ask that once you receive a letter in the mail informing you about the installation that you keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time.           13.   Can I make an appointment for the upgrade?     If you require planned water disruption, or any further assistance, please call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521. \u00a0 \u00a0            14.   After my meter was upgraded/replaced, my water was discolored. Is it still safe?     Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration. Your water remains safe and meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. Please run cold water from a fixture without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water and use it for watering plants.           15.   Have other water districts implemented AMI?     Locally, Dublin San Ramon Services District, City of Pleasanton, City of Hayward, San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and many others have adopted AMI technology in recent years. Hundreds of utility districts across North America have adopted AMI technology for their meter infrastructure needs. This technology has been approved for use in California since 2006 and has become the standard for water meter reading technology.           16.   Is there a cost associated with these AMI improvements?     There is no additional cost to customers for upgrading our meters. The AMI improvements have been fully budgeted in the District\u2019s long term financial plan. Furthermore, because meters that can be read remotely greatly reduce vehicle and other expenses, the District expects the AMI improvements to save money over the long term. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           17.   Will my information be secure?        Yes. Preserving the security of our customers\u2019 data and personal information is one of ACWD\u2019s top priorities. The AMI system will feature advanced encryption technologies that will keep your data safe.           18.   Is AMI technology safe?      Yes. As your neighbor, ACWD takes great pride in providing safe drinking water to the communities we serve. The District would never undertake a project that could be harmful to the health or privacy of the members of our community and we will do everything in our power to ensure that this project is no different.           19.   Is AMI technology a wise investment?      Yes. The District has evaluated AMI and found that the return on investment will save money for the District over time while also enhancing the value and customer service the District provides. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           20.   Will the AMI technology attach to the current manually read meter or will it be placed somewhere else on residents\u2019 property?     Many of our meters are approaching the end of life and are not AMI compatible, so we will be upgrading the meters at these locations. The AMI device will attach to the meter in the meter box and be mounted to the underside of a new lid that will be installed as part of the meter replacement project.           21.   How does the new AMI technology work, and how will the meters be read?     The AMI technology employs a device that utilizes the cellular network, just like your mobile phone and also found in televisions and wireless home phones. This technology allows meters to be read remotely giving customers daily access to their water consumption data. Not only do the AMI device\u2019s radio frequency (RF) waves fall below the level of what is recommended by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), they are also less powerful than any mobile phone. Additionally, the AMI technology inside your water meter is located outside your house, which reduces contact with the RF waves.           22.   How will we be able to recognize the AMI technology installers? Will they be wearing ACWD uniforms?     ACWD has partnered with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI has successfully installed more than 1 million integrated meters, just like the ones you will be receiving, and are highly skilled at the installation process. The PMI installation team will carry a letter for our customers that will explain their work on the new meters. The PMI and ACWD Advanced Meter logos will be on their uniforms, badges, and on their trucks. You will be able to recognize the PMI installation team, as they will wear a distinct uniform that includes a: \u00a0Neon green T-shirt with the PMI logo and the ACWD Advanced Metering logo \u00a0PMI badge displaying the ACWD Advanced Metering logo and including Their name; Photo; Issue Date; And a number to call to confirm their identity.           23.   Will ACWD be hiring installers locally?     ACWD is partnering with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc. (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI will hire up to 30 Bay Area-based installers for this project, bringing jobs to the region. Customers will recognize them because of their neon green uniforms and trucks with PMI/ACWD logos. Installers will also carry a photo ID badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project. The installers are following all federal, state, and county local, state and CDC guidelines as well as local regulations, and we ask our customers to please do the same.           24.   How long will the installation take?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time. No one\u2019s water will be shut off for more than an hour unless otherwise communicated.           25.   When will I be notified about when the installers will upgrade my meter?     You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance. You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is completed We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           26.   There is someone else that has come to check my newly upgraded or replaced AMI compatible water meter, but they are not from Badger Meter or Professional Meters Inc. (PMI). Who are they?     You may also see one of our quality control technicians during or after installation. We\u2019ve partnered with Utility Partners of America UPA) to inspect our installation and ensure it meets our standards. Like installers, the quality control technician will carry a badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project.           27.   I received a notice of a pre-existing customer leak. What does this mean? Why wasn\u2019t my meter installed?     Your AMI meter could not be installed due to a pre-existing customer plumbing leak. As it was found to be customer side, it is your responsibility to fix the leak before installation can take place. ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors adopted an Ordinance Prohibiting Wasteful Use of Water, ORDINANCE NO. 2008-01 (Ordinance) which was adopted by ACWD\u2019s Board to conserve the District\u2019s water supply and eliminate the wasteful use of water, especially critical due to the drought. Under this Ordinance leaks are required to be repaired as soon as possible. ACWD can invoke the enforcement process under this Ordinance for non-compliance with the Ordinance. Once the leak has been fixed and you are ready for installation, please call our Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521.           28.   What if my question is not answered here?     More information, including meeting details and how to take our survey, can be found at ACWD.ORG/AMI. \u00a0The AMI Project Team provided a Virtual Community Informational Meeting on November 16, 2021. \u00a0In case you weren't able to join us, but are interested in learning more:\u00a0 \u00ad\u00adHere's the link to the\u00a0 Presentation Material .

If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access.Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Temporary Water Stoppage:\u00a0 During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time.

What is AMI technology?     The Alameda County Water District (ACWD) is investing in the future of our community by installing Advanced Metering Infrastructure, more commonly known as AMI. This new technology allows water meters to be read remotely for faster leak detection, an increase in customers\u2019 ability to monitor, analyze, and compare consumption data from our user-friendly  My Smart Water Connect  web portal, and creates an overall improved customer experience.           2.   What are the benefits of AMI for me?     AMI allows water meters to be read remotely so customers can: \u2022 Detect potential leaks early \u2022 Reduce surprise water bills \u2022 View up-to-date water usage This new tool supports customers\u2019 water efficiency efforts and reduces the agency\u2019s carbon footprint with fewer trucks on the road since water meters will soon be read remotely instead of manually once every two months. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.\u00a0           3.

You will recognize them because of their neon green ACWD/PMI uniforms and photo ID badges. Installers will also carry a letter to authenticate their work on the project. CDC Guidelines Followed:\u00a0 The installers are following all federal, state, and county local, state and CDC guidelines as well as local regulations, and we ask our customers to please do the same. Clear a Path:\u00a0 Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time. If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access. Temporary Water Stoppage:\u00a0 During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time. No one\u2019s water will be shut off for more than an hour unless otherwise communicated. \u2022 Temporary Water Discoloration: Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration. Your water remains safe and meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. Please run cold water from a fixture without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water and use it for watering plants.           7.   Why does ACWD need to upgrade my current water meter?     In order to bring you these new AMI services and capabilities, your current water meter will need to be upgraded to one that it is AMI compatible. Many of the meters we have in service now are nearing the end of their useful life and will need to be replaced in the coming years anyway. By replacing them with AMI compatible meters, we can enhance current customer service offerings and make available new and enhanced services like leak alerts, timely usage measurements and usage alerts to reduce surprise water bills.           8.   Why is ACWD doing this AMI Project now?     The implementation of AMI technology will help the District continue to improve the cost-effectiveness and value of District services. Additionally, ACWD is committed to outstanding customer service and promoting open communication with our customers, and AMI technology will further improve our ability to do just that. The District also has a long-standing commitment to stewardship of water resources and the environment, and AMI technology will also advance that tradition by further reducing the environmental impacts of our operations. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability \u00a0 for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           9.   When will my water meter be upgraded? How will I know?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. A map of the AMI deployment progress providing an estimated timeframe for when your location will be upgrade to AMI technology is located at our user-friendly  My Smart Water Connect  web portal. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is complete We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           10.   How can I prepare for my upgrade?     \u2022\u00a0 Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access. \u2022\u00a0 Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time. If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). \u00a0\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Your water service will be temporarily turned off \u2014 for no more than one hour unless otherwise communicated \u2014 for the installation of the AMI device. If you have a water-dependent device, such as a recirculation pump, you will need to turn it off before your upgrade to avoid possible damage.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 If you have tenants associated with this billing address, please notify them.           11.   I have a smart home water monitoring device attached to my water meter. What should I do? Is it the same as a new AMI meter?     A smart home water monitoring device is a great tool and can typically record water use at 1-minute intervals and be seen in real time in an app. The new AMI meter upgrade you will receive monitors use at 15-minute intervals and data is available the next day in the ACWD My Smart Water Connect customer portal and mobile app. This is the main difference between the two devices. However, as of now, some smart home water monitoring devices, such as the Flume, are not compatible with the ultra-sonic meters that ACWD is installing as part of the AMI upgrade. \u00a0You will need to remove your smart home water monitoring device prior to the AMI upgrade. You will receive a door hanger within 10 working days before the installers arrive to upgrade the meter. If you do not remove your smart home water monitoring device beforehand, ACWD\u2019s contractor will leave a door hanger indicating they cannot access the meter and request that you call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521 to let our installation partners know when the device has been removed.           12.   Will I need to do anything to sign up to receive my AMI meter upgrade?     No. You will be notified before and after the AMI meter is installed, but you don\u2019t need to sign-up to receive the new meter. However, we do ask that once you receive a letter in the mail informing you about the installation that you keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time.           13.   Can I make an appointment for the upgrade?     If you require planned water disruption, or any further assistance, please call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521. \u00a0 \u00a0            14.   After my meter was upgraded/replaced, my water was discolored. Is it still safe?     Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration. Your water remains safe and meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. Please run cold water from a fixture without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water and use it for watering plants.           15.   Have other water districts implemented AMI?     Locally, Dublin San Ramon Services District, City of Pleasanton, City of Hayward, San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and many others have adopted AMI technology in recent years. Hundreds of utility districts across North America have adopted AMI technology for their meter infrastructure needs. This technology has been approved for use in California since 2006 and has become the standard for water meter reading technology.           16.   Is there a cost associated with these AMI improvements?     There is no additional cost to customers for upgrading our meters. The AMI improvements have been fully budgeted in the District\u2019s long term financial plan. Furthermore, because meters that can be read remotely greatly reduce vehicle and other expenses, the District expects the AMI improvements to save money over the long term. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           17.   Will my information be secure?        Yes. Preserving the security of our customers\u2019 data and personal information is one of ACWD\u2019s top priorities. The AMI system will feature advanced encryption technologies that will keep your data safe.           18.   Is AMI technology safe?      Yes. As your neighbor, ACWD takes great pride in providing safe drinking water to the communities we serve. The District would never undertake a project that could be harmful to the health or privacy of the members of our community and we will do everything in our power to ensure that this project is no different.           19.   Is AMI technology a wise investment?      Yes. The District has evaluated AMI and found that the return on investment will save money for the District over time while also enhancing the value and customer service the District provides. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           20.   Will the AMI technology attach to the current manually read meter or will it be placed somewhere else on residents\u2019 property?     Many of our meters are approaching the end of life and are not AMI compatible, so we will be upgrading the meters at these locations. The AMI device will attach to the meter in the meter box and be mounted to the underside of a new lid that will be installed as part of the meter replacement project.           21.   How does the new AMI technology work, and how will the meters be read?     The AMI technology employs a device that utilizes the cellular network, just like your mobile phone and also found in televisions and wireless home phones. This technology allows meters to be read remotely giving customers daily access to their water consumption data. Not only do the AMI device\u2019s radio frequency (RF) waves fall below the level of what is recommended by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), they are also less powerful than any mobile phone. Additionally, the AMI technology inside your water meter is located outside your house, which reduces contact with the RF waves.           22.   How will we be able to recognize the AMI technology installers? Will they be wearing ACWD uniforms?     ACWD has partnered with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI has successfully installed more than 1 million integrated meters, just like the ones you will be receiving, and are highly skilled at the installation process. The PMI installation team will carry a letter for our customers that will explain their work on the new meters. The PMI and ACWD Advanced Meter logos will be on their uniforms, badges, and on their trucks. You will be able to recognize the PMI installation team, as they will wear a distinct uniform that includes a: \u00a0Neon green T-shirt with the PMI logo and the ACWD Advanced Metering logo \u00a0PMI badge displaying the ACWD Advanced Metering logo and including Their name; Photo; Issue Date; And a number to call to confirm their identity.           23.   Will ACWD be hiring installers locally?     ACWD is partnering with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc. (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI will hire up to 30 Bay Area-based installers for this project, bringing jobs to the region. Customers will recognize them because of their neon green uniforms and trucks with PMI/ACWD logos. Installers will also carry a photo ID badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project. The installers are following all federal, state, and county local, state and CDC guidelines as well as local regulations, and we ask our customers to please do the same.           24.   How long will the installation take?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time. No one\u2019s water will be shut off for more than an hour unless otherwise communicated.           25.   When will I be notified about when the installers will upgrade my meter?     You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance. You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is completed We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           26.   There is someone else that has come to check my newly upgraded or replaced AMI compatible water meter, but they are not from Badger Meter or Professional Meters Inc. (PMI). Who are they?     You may also see one of our quality control technicians during or after installation. We\u2019ve partnered with Utility Partners of America UPA) to inspect our installation and ensure it meets our standards. Like installers, the quality control technician will carry a badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project.           27.   I received a notice of a pre-existing customer leak. What does this mean? Why wasn\u2019t my meter installed?     Your AMI meter could not be installed due to a pre-existing customer plumbing leak. As it was found to be customer side, it is your responsibility to fix the leak before installation can take place. ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors adopted an Ordinance Prohibiting Wasteful Use of Water, ORDINANCE NO. 2008-01 (Ordinance) which was adopted by ACWD\u2019s Board to conserve the District\u2019s water supply and eliminate the wasteful use of water, especially critical due to the drought. Under this Ordinance leaks are required to be repaired as soon as possible. ACWD can invoke the enforcement process under this Ordinance for non-compliance with the Ordinance. Once the leak has been fixed and you are ready for installation, please call our Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521.           28.   What if my question is not answered here?     More information, including meeting details and how to take our survey, can be found at ACWD.ORG/AMI. \u00a0The AMI Project Team provided a Virtual Community Informational Meeting on November 16, 2021. \u00a0In case you weren't able to join us, but are interested in learning more:\u00a0 \u00ad\u00adHere's the link to the\u00a0 Presentation Material .

Why does ACWD need to upgrade my current water meter?     In order to bring you these new AMI services and capabilities, your current water meter will need to be upgraded to one that it is AMI compatible. Many of the meters we have in service now are nearing the end of their useful life and will need to be replaced in the coming years anyway. By replacing them with AMI compatible meters, we can enhance current customer service offerings and make available new and enhanced services like leak alerts, timely usage measurements and usage alerts to reduce surprise water bills.           8.   Why is ACWD doing this AMI Project now?     The implementation of AMI technology will help the District continue to improve the cost-effectiveness and value of District services. Additionally, ACWD is committed to outstanding customer service and promoting open communication with our customers, and AMI technology will further improve our ability to do just that. The District also has a long-standing commitment to stewardship of water resources and the environment, and AMI technology will also advance that tradition by further reducing the environmental impacts of our operations. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability \u00a0 for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           9.   When will my water meter be upgraded? How will I know?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. A map of the AMI deployment progress providing an estimated timeframe for when your location will be upgrade to AMI technology is located at our user-friendly  My Smart Water Connect  web portal. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is complete We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           10.   How can I prepare for my upgrade?     \u2022\u00a0 Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access. \u2022\u00a0 Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time. If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). \u00a0\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Your water service will be temporarily turned off \u2014 for no more than one hour unless otherwise communicated \u2014 for the installation of the AMI device. If you have a water-dependent device, such as a recirculation pump, you will need to turn it off before your upgrade to avoid possible damage.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 If you have tenants associated with this billing address, please notify them.           11.   I have a smart home water monitoring device attached to my water meter. What should I do? Is it the same as a new AMI meter?     A smart home water monitoring device is a great tool and can typically record water use at 1-minute intervals and be seen in real time in an app. The new AMI meter upgrade you will receive monitors use at 15-minute intervals and data is available the next day in the ACWD My Smart Water Connect customer portal and mobile app. This is the main difference between the two devices. However, as of now, some smart home water monitoring devices, such as the Flume, are not compatible with the ultra-sonic meters that ACWD is installing as part of the AMI upgrade. \u00a0You will need to remove your smart home water monitoring device prior to the AMI upgrade. You will receive a door hanger within 10 working days before the installers arrive to upgrade the meter. If you do not remove your smart home water monitoring device beforehand, ACWD\u2019s contractor will leave a door hanger indicating they cannot access the meter and request that you call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521 to let our installation partners know when the device has been removed.           12.   Will I need to do anything to sign up to receive my AMI meter upgrade?     No. You will be notified before and after the AMI meter is installed, but you don\u2019t need to sign-up to receive the new meter. However, we do ask that once you receive a letter in the mail informing you about the installation that you keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time.           13.   Can I make an appointment for the upgrade?     If you require planned water disruption, or any further assistance, please call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521. \u00a0 \u00a0            14.   After my meter was upgraded/replaced, my water was discolored. Is it still safe?     Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration. Your water remains safe and meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. Please run cold water from a fixture without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water and use it for watering plants.           15.   Have other water districts implemented AMI?     Locally, Dublin San Ramon Services District, City of Pleasanton, City of Hayward, San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and many others have adopted AMI technology in recent years. Hundreds of utility districts across North America have adopted AMI technology for their meter infrastructure needs. This technology has been approved for use in California since 2006 and has become the standard for water meter reading technology.           16.   Is there a cost associated with these AMI improvements?     There is no additional cost to customers for upgrading our meters. The AMI improvements have been fully budgeted in the District\u2019s long term financial plan. Furthermore, because meters that can be read remotely greatly reduce vehicle and other expenses, the District expects the AMI improvements to save money over the long term. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           17.   Will my information be secure?        Yes. Preserving the security of our customers\u2019 data and personal information is one of ACWD\u2019s top priorities. The AMI system will feature advanced encryption technologies that will keep your data safe.           18.   Is AMI technology safe?      Yes. As your neighbor, ACWD takes great pride in providing safe drinking water to the communities we serve. The District would never undertake a project that could be harmful to the health or privacy of the members of our community and we will do everything in our power to ensure that this project is no different.           19.   Is AMI technology a wise investment?      Yes. The District has evaluated AMI and found that the return on investment will save money for the District over time while also enhancing the value and customer service the District provides. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           20.   Will the AMI technology attach to the current manually read meter or will it be placed somewhere else on residents\u2019 property?     Many of our meters are approaching the end of life and are not AMI compatible, so we will be upgrading the meters at these locations. The AMI device will attach to the meter in the meter box and be mounted to the underside of a new lid that will be installed as part of the meter replacement project.           21.   How does the new AMI technology work, and how will the meters be read?     The AMI technology employs a device that utilizes the cellular network, just like your mobile phone and also found in televisions and wireless home phones. This technology allows meters to be read remotely giving customers daily access to their water consumption data. Not only do the AMI device\u2019s radio frequency (RF) waves fall below the level of what is recommended by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), they are also less powerful than any mobile phone. Additionally, the AMI technology inside your water meter is located outside your house, which reduces contact with the RF waves.           22.   How will we be able to recognize the AMI technology installers? Will they be wearing ACWD uniforms?     ACWD has partnered with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI has successfully installed more than 1 million integrated meters, just like the ones you will be receiving, and are highly skilled at the installation process. The PMI installation team will carry a letter for our customers that will explain their work on the new meters. The PMI and ACWD Advanced Meter logos will be on their uniforms, badges, and on their trucks. You will be able to recognize the PMI installation team, as they will wear a distinct uniform that includes a: \u00a0Neon green T-shirt with the PMI logo and the ACWD Advanced Metering logo \u00a0PMI badge displaying the ACWD Advanced Metering logo and including Their name; Photo; Issue Date; And a number to call to confirm their identity.           23.   Will ACWD be hiring installers locally?     ACWD is partnering with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc. (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI will hire up to 30 Bay Area-based installers for this project, bringing jobs to the region. Customers will recognize them because of their neon green uniforms and trucks with PMI/ACWD logos. Installers will also carry a photo ID badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project. The installers are following all federal, state, and county local, state and CDC guidelines as well as local regulations, and we ask our customers to please do the same.           24.   How long will the installation take?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time. No one\u2019s water will be shut off for more than an hour unless otherwise communicated.           25.   When will I be notified about when the installers will upgrade my meter?     You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance. You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is completed We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           26.   There is someone else that has come to check my newly upgraded or replaced AMI compatible water meter, but they are not from Badger Meter or Professional Meters Inc. (PMI). Who are they?     You may also see one of our quality control technicians during or after installation. We\u2019ve partnered with Utility Partners of America UPA) to inspect our installation and ensure it meets our standards. Like installers, the quality control technician will carry a badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project.           27.   I received a notice of a pre-existing customer leak. What does this mean? Why wasn\u2019t my meter installed?     Your AMI meter could not be installed due to a pre-existing customer plumbing leak. As it was found to be customer side, it is your responsibility to fix the leak before installation can take place. ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors adopted an Ordinance Prohibiting Wasteful Use of Water, ORDINANCE NO. 2008-01 (Ordinance) which was adopted by ACWD\u2019s Board to conserve the District\u2019s water supply and eliminate the wasteful use of water, especially critical due to the drought. Under this Ordinance leaks are required to be repaired as soon as possible. ACWD can invoke the enforcement process under this Ordinance for non-compliance with the Ordinance. Once the leak has been fixed and you are ready for installation, please call our Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521.           28.   What if my question is not answered here?

ACWD offers existing fire hydrant flow data to customers free of charge, provided the data is in close proximity to the desired location or project site, and the data is less than 5-years old.\u00a0 ACWD will need to perform a new fire flow test in the event the existing data is older than 5-years, or is no longer representative of the existing ACWD water distribution system.\u00a0 Once the application is submitted, an ACWD Engineering Technician will reach out to you regarding the status of the flow test data, and whether or not a new fire flow test will need to be performed.\u00a0 ACWD charges  $247 per fire flow test . If payment is required, please make the check payable to  Alameda County Water District  and to the address below. Please be sure to attention the envelope or payment to the Alameda County Water District Engineering Department. Alameda County Water District -\u00a0 Engineering Department 43885 South Grimmer Boulevard, Fremont, CA 94538 Although reasonable efforts will be made to perform the fire flow test on the hydrants closest to the requested location, ACWD cannot guarantee that the nearest hydrants will be available for testing. Obstacles (i.e. parked cars, trees, posts, landscaping, etc.) and nozzle configurations or flow orientations may prevent ACWD from flowing particular hydrants.
