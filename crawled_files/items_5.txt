This water is imported from the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta and/or Lake Del Valle via the South Bay Aqueduct and is purified at our water treatment plants before being delivered to customers living in central and south Fremont. Storage Facilities The SWP, managed by the DWR, is the largest state-built, multi-purpose water project in the country. The SWP facilities include 21 dams and reservoirs; 21 pumping plants; 4 pumping-generating plants; 5 hydroelectric power plants; and approximately 700 miles of aqueducts. The water stored in the SWP storage facilities originates from rainfall and snowmelt runoff in Northern and Central California watersheds. The SWP's primary storage facility is Lake Oroville in the Feather River Watershed. Releases from Lake Oroville flow down the Feather River to the Sacramento River, which subsequently flows to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Water Delivery The SWP diverts water from the Delta through the Banks Pumping Plant which lifts water from the Clifton Court Forebay (in the Delta) to the California Aqueduct and Bethany Reservoir. From Bethany Reservoir, the South Bay Pumping Plant lifts water into the South Bay Aqueduct, which delivers State Water Project supplies to ACWD and other Bay Area water agencies in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties.

These agencies are known jointly as the SBA Contractors. In 2005, the South Bay Aqueduct Watershed Workgroup was formed to help protect water quality within the aqueduct by protecting the watershed lands surrounding it. The workgroup had three primary objectives: Develop a Watershed Management Program for the South Bay Aqueduct system, including Lake Del Valle and Bethany Reservoir. Protect local drinking water from identified contaminant sources. Protect water resources in the local area for urban, agricultural, recreational, and environmental uses. Sponsors This project was sponsored by a Proposition 13 Non-point Source Pollution Control Grant from the State Water Resource Control Board for the CALFED Bay-Delta Program and guided by the South Bay Aqueduct Watershed Workgroup.

This supply is predominantly from the Sierra Nevada, delivered through the Hetch-Hetchy aqueducts, but also includes treated water produced by the SFPUC from its local watersheds and facilities in Alameda and San Mateo Counties. The amount of imported water available to the SFPUC's retail and wholesale customers is constrained by hydrology, physical facilities, and the institutional parameters that allocate the water supply of the Tuolumne River. Due to these constraints, the SFPUC is very dependent on reservoir storage to firm-up its water supplies. Water System Improvement Program In order to enhance the ability of the SFPUC water supply system to meet identified service goals for water quality, seismic reliability, delivery reliability, and water supply, the SFPUC has undertaken the Water System Improvement Program.

This runoff, together with water released from the South Bay Aqueduct at a location east of the town of Sunol, flows down Alameda Creek and into the Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel. Here, the water is captured behind three large, inflatable rubber dams. These dams divert water to the Quarry Lakes where water percolates to recharge the underlying groundwater basin. About sixteen wells are used to extract water from the groundwater basin. Together, these wells are capable of producing up to 47.5 million gallons of water per day. This water is blended with San Francisco Regional Water System supplies before being delivered to customers. Groundwater Monitoring The continued protection and enhancement of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin is vital to ACWD's ability to continue to meet the water supply needs of the people it serves. Consequently, the basin has been the object of vigorous conservation activities on the part of the District.

Tour-goers will get a near fish-eye-view of the journey Anna, the steelhead trout, will be able to take once our projects are complete.  These projects have been decades in the making, with the help of our many partners, and are now nearing completion. We'll show the magnitude of these $78 million dollar projects (with partner support and grants) designed to allow threatened steelhead trout, like Anna and other fish species, to migrate easily and safely upstream and downstream. The project will also allow ACWD to maintain reliable water supplies for residents and businesses in Fremont, Newark and Union City. Following the 45-minute tour is\u00a0 a 15-minute Q&A session with ACWD staff.

Diablo in the north to Mt. Hamilton in the south, and east to Altamont Pass. The area is populated by more than 200,000 people living in five cities\u2014Dublin, parts of Danville and San Ramon, Livermore, Pleasanton\u2014and thousands more living in unincorporated areas. Most of the watershed is undeveloped, open range. Another large portion is comprised of public lands and parks. A smaller portion is used as cropland. Only about seven percent of the total acreage is used for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes. The average rainfall in the Alameda Creek watershed is approximately 20 inches per year. Runoff from much of the southern region is collected in Calaveras and San Antonio Reservoirs, which are part of San Francisco's water system. Runoff from much of the southeast portion is collected in Del Valle Reservoir, some of which is diverted to ACWD via the South Bay Aqueduct. Runoff from the northern region flows to tributaries of Alameda Creek, where it is carried to ACWD facilities and used for groundwater recharge. The Supply Virtually all of our local water supply (which comprises 40% of our total distribution system supply) originates in the Alameda Creek watershed. Rainwater runoff from the watershed and a portion of our State Water Project supply is captured behind three large, inflatable rubber dams which span the width of the Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel. These dams divert water to several hundred acres of ponds (former gravel quarries) where water percolates to recharge the underlying Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. Watershed Protection Protecting the integrity of the watershed is of critical importance to ACWD. The District continuously samples, analyzes, and monitors the quality of water in Alameda Creek at a special monitoring facility located at the mouth of Niles Canyon near Mission Boulevard and at other key locations throughout the watershed. In addition, we work with property owners and other agencies to encourage proper use of watershed lands so that the water quality in the creek is protected and maintained.

EBRPD operates the park as a recreational facility featuring water-related activities such as swimming, \u00a0fishing, wind surfing, and boating. ACWD uses the lakes for recharging the aquifers of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin, an immense, natural reservoir lying beneath the Tri-City area. This is accomplished by: Storing water in the Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel behind inflatable rubber dams; Diverting the stored water into the Quarry Lakes; Allowing the lake water to percolate into the groundwater basin. The Niles Cone supplies up to half of the water used in Fremont, Newark, and Union City. More Information Find out more about the recreational opportunities available at Quarry Lakes by visiting the  EBRPD website . For the Quarry Lakes fish planting schedule, see EBRPD's  Angler's Edge Online . To protect wildlife and water quality, lead fishing tackle is prohibited at Quarry Lakes. The  Quarry Lakes Lead Fishing Tackle Awareness and Exchange Program  was created to educate local anglers on the hazards of using lead fishing tackle and to provide the opportunity for a no-cost exchange of toxic lead split-shot weights and sinkers for lead-free split-shot weights and sinkers.

ACWD dedicates this page to our past Directors who have shown outstanding dedication, knowledge and direction, providing the groundwork for the successful organization ACWD is today.

Home About Us About ACWD History                         History\t\t               Alameda County Water District Since 1914, the Alameda County Water District has served the communities we now know as Fremont, Newark and Union City. The history of the District has been closely intertwined with the area it serves throughout this time. In fact, the District was originally formed to protect and responsibly manage the Niles Cone groundwater basin, which underlies the local area. Since then, the District has seen significant change, but continues a tradition of stewardship in meeting our mission to provide a reliable supply of high quality water at a reasonable price.

Home About Us About ACWD Board of Directors Ward-Based Election System                         Ward-Based Election System\t\t               As of November 2022, Members of ACWD's Board of Directors are Elected Based on Voting District Wards (also known as \"Districts\" or \"Zones\") The Alameda County Water District Board of Directors transitioned from at-large to ward-based elections in 2022. Voters within the ACWD service area now elect their representatives on the ACWD Board based on which ward they are in, and voters only elect one representative for their ward. Voters in wards 2 and 3 elect their representatives every four years beginning in November 2022. \u00a0 Voters in wards 1, 4, and 5 elect their representatives every four years beginning in November 2024. ACWD's Completed Transition for At-Large to Ward-Based Elections Background The Alameda County Water District Board of Directors has completed the transition from at-large to ward-based elections. Prior to this process, the Board of Directors was elected using an at-large elections system, which means voters of the entire District elected the five Board members. A ward-based election is one in which the District is geographically divided into separate wards, each with one Board member who resides in the ward and is chosen by the voters in that particular ward \u00a0 Directors serve four-year staggered terms and are elected in even-numbered years. The District received a letter from a law firm alleging that the District\u2019s current at-large elections violate the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) (Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 14025-14032). \u00a0The CVRA prohibits the use of at-large elections if doing so impairs the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice or to influence the outcome of an election. \u00a0Numerous public agencies, including the District, have been contacted by private law firms alleging violations of the CVRA in a push to move agencies to ward-based (also known as \"district\" or \"zone-based\") election systems. \u00a0The District does not agree with these allegations with respect to elections of the District\u2019s Board of Directors. \u00a0However, the Board desires that its members represent the interests and wishes of all residents within the jurisdiction of the District, and that the community have confidence that the Board continues to represent the interests and wishes of the District. \u00a0Therefore, on August 12, 2021, the Board adopted  Resolution No. 21-050  declaring its intention to change from at-large to ward-based elections. \u00a0                        The Transition Process Community input and 2020 census data was used to determine how wards should be drawn. \u00a0 To assist with the transition, the District hired Lapkoff & Gobalet Demographic Research, Inc. (Lapkoff and Gobalet), a firm that specializes in drawing election ward boundaries for jurisdictions, also known as \u201cdistricting.\u201d Many factors may be considered in developing the wards and draft maps. \u00a0Population equality is of primary importance, followed by the Federal Voting Rights Act\u2019s prohibition of voting practices and procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. Additionally, other factors include: Topography: natural barriers, boundaries or landmarks Geography: major streets and neighborhood blocks Cohesiveness: contiguity, integrity and compactness of the area Communities of Interest: established neighborhoods, racial and social demographics, groups with cultural bonds, common issues or concerns, voting precincts and other types of divisions.\u00a0 The District emphasized public input throughout the transition process. \u00a0The District conducted five duly noticed public hearings over two phases to review the process of converting to a ward-based election system, receive input from the public on communities of interest within the District\u2019s service area, and review and receive public input on draft voting district ward maps: Phase 1: Community Input On October 14, 2021, and October 28, 2021, the District conducted duly noticed public hearings to describe the transition process and solicit public input on communities of interest and other factors that should be considered in the development of draft voting district ward maps. \u00a0Lapkoff and Gobalet considered such input, together with the most current federal census data, in the development of five draft voting district ward maps which were published and posted on the District\u2019s website on January 3, 2022. Phase 2: Voting District Ward Mapping On January 13, 2022, the District conducted a third duly noticed public hearing to present the five draft voting district ward maps and receive input from the public and from the Board. \u00a0Based on input received during this public hearing, two of the draft maps (Plan numbers 4 and 5) were removed from further consideration. On February 17, 2022, the District conducted a fourth duly noticed public hearing to present the three remaining draft voting district ward maps and receive further input from the public and from the Board. \u00a0At this public hearing, Lapkoff and Gobalet provided additional details regarding the differences among the three draft maps, and the sequence of elections was discussed. On March 10, 2022, the District conducted a fifth duly noticed public hearing to present the remaining draft voting district ward maps, including the potential boundaries of the five proposed wards, for public input regarding configuration of the wards and communities of interest to assist in selecting the final voting district ward map, as well as the final sequence of elections. \u00a0Following the public hearing, the Board adopted an ordinance establishing a final voting district ward map ( Plan 3  ) and sequence of elections. The adopted sequence of elections is as follows: Voters in wards 2 and 3 elect their representatives every four years beginning in November 2022. \u00a0 Voters in wards 1, 4, and 5 elect their representatives every four years beginning in November 2024.

These terms all used \u00a0to describe the distinct geographical area from which voters elect their ACWD representative. During the transition process the terms \"voting district\" and \"zone\" were used to describe these areas. However, because the Alameda County Registrar of Voters prefers the term \"ward,\" customer communications and interactive maps use this term to align with County election materials and related documents and processes.
