For more than one hundred years, our primary mission has been to provide our customers with a high quality, reliable supply of water at a reasonable cost. Over those years we have used different means to communicate with our customers on issues of current interest.

We hope you will enjoy browsing our website, find it to be a useful source of information, and that you will use it to communicate your comments, questions, and concerns back to us.

The smaller and less complex pipeline renewal projects support the large-diameter transmission main renewal projects currently in progress.\u00a0 With planned construction on an as-needed basis, the Small Diameter Pipeline Renewal Program will provide more consistent year-to-year progress and expenditures within the District\u2019s Main Renewal Program. \u00a0\u00a0 The Small Diameter Pipeline Renewal Program includes nine project sites. Each site is comprised of multiple water mains and was chosen based on material type, age, and maintenance history. The water mains are generally older pipelines located in residential areas throughout Fremont, Newark, and Union City. Status The  Lindsay Tract Roadway and Drainage Improvements Project  is being led by the City of Newark, and ACWD is partnering to replace aging water mains for cost efficiency and to minimize impacts on customers. The water main replacement will be entirely funded through ACWD\u2019s Capital Improvements Program budget. Location Multiple project sites throughout Fremont, Newark, and Union City.

Home About Us Water Quality Understanding PFAS                         Understanding PFAS\t\t               ACWD Is Committed to Monitoring for PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances)\u00a0 Per \u2013 and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) In recent years, people have become more familiar with the term PFAS. PFAS are manmade compounds that have been used to make carpets, clothing, fabrics for furniture, paper packaging for food, electronics, personal hygiene products, and other materials (e.g., cookware) designed to be waterproof, stain-resistant, or non-stick. Of particular interest are four compounds that have Notification Levels. Perfluorooctanoic Acid, more commonly referred to as PFOA, Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid, or PFOS, Perfluorobutane Sulfonic Acid or PFBS, and Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid or PFHxS. Notification levels are health-based advisory levels established by the State Water Resource Control Board Division of Drinking Water for contaminants that may be regulated in the future. Used in many consumer and industrial products for their ability to repel stains, water, and oil, PFAS are persistent in the environment and do not readily degrade. They have been in use since the 1940s and are prevalent in many items we encounter daily \u2013 inside and outside the home. While items imported from outside the United States may contain PFAS, its use is being phased out in the US. \u00a0 Find more information on ACWD\u2019s proactive approach to detect PFAS in the water supply in our  PFAS Fact Sheet .                        Identifying sources of PFAS is critical to water quality \u00a0\u00a0 Water agencies across the country are working to identify sources and treatment of PFAS in water supplies. \u00a0Water source supplies vary throughout the country, state and region with the most common sources of water being surface water and groundwater. In March 2019, the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) began a state-wide PFAS investigation and issued orders to approximately 200 water utilities throughout California to test groundwater wells that are in close proximity to fire training/fire response sites (e.g., airfields), industrial sites, landfills, and/or wastewater treatment plants for PFAS. Since ACWD groundwater sources are not located near potential sources of contamination, ACWD was  not issued  orders to monitor for PFAS by the State Board at that time. In March 2020, ACWD elected to undertake a voluntary sampling program starting in June 2020, to monitor for the presence of PFAS in groundwater and surface water sources and the treated water being provided to our customers. Effective January 1, 2023, ACWD received monitoring orders by the State Board to monitor for PFAS compounds on a quarterly basis in all source groundwater. \u00a0The voluntary monitoring conducted since June 2020 meets all the requirements of this order and ACWD will continue its regular quarterly monitoring. \u00a0Data will continue to be posted on the website. ACWD\u2019s proactive approach to PFAS The Alameda County Water District is committed to delivering high-quality drinking water to our customers. This commitment included a voluntary approach to monitoring drinking water for PFAS, prior to being issued monitoring orders by the Division of Drinking Water. Our findings from the PFAS monitoring confirm that no ACWD customers are receiving water with concentrations of PFOS/PFOA, PFBS, or PFHxS above the notification levels and meets all state and federal drinking water quality standards. View the detailed results of the  April 2022 through March 2023  PFAS compounds with notification levels. View  all  detailed results of the  April 2022 through March 2023  PFAS compounds. ACWD\u2019s diverse water supply improves water quality, reliability, and flexibility ACWD has a unique and diverse water supply. This diversity allows for operational adjustments to maximize water quality and reliability. \u00a0 The threat of contamination, a natural disaster or drought are some potential risks to our water supply. That is why we continuously take steps to identify, reduce or mitigate these risks and are prepared to adapt operations when needed.

What are PFAS?  Per \u2013 and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)     PFAS are manmade compounds that have been used to make carpets, clothing, fabrics for furniture, paper packaging for food, electronics, personal hygiene products, and other materials (e.g., cookware) designed to be waterproof, stain-resistant, or non-stick. Of particular interest are four compounds that have notification levels. Perfluorooctanoic Acid, more commonly referred to as PFOA, Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid, or PFOS, Perfluorobutane Sulfonic Acid or PFBS, and Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid or PFHxS. In recent years people have become more familiar with the term PFAS. Although awareness of these manmade chemical compounds is recent, PFAS have been in wide use since the 1940s. Used in many consumer and industrial products for their ability to repel stains, water, and oil, PFAS are persistent in the environment and do not readily degrade. \u00a0They also are prevalent in many items we encounter daily \u2013 inside and outside the home. While items imported from outside the United States may contain PFAS, its use is being phased out in the US. \u00a0           2.   What are the sources of PFAS?     PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, and PFHxS are man-made compounds that have been used to make carpets, clothing, fabrics for furniture, paper packaging for food, electronics, personal hygiene products, and other materials (e.g., cookware) designed to be waterproof, stain-resistant, or non-stick. PFOA and PFOS were also used for firefighting at airfields and in several industrial processes. PFBS has been identified in the environment and consumer products, including surface water, dust, carpeting and carpet cleaners, floor wax, and food packaging. PFAS are persistent in the environment and do not breakdown easily.            3.   What are the health effects from PFAS?     According to the US EPA, there is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse health outcomes in humans. If humans, or animals, ingest PFAS (by eating or drinking food or water than contain PFAS), the PFAS are absorbed, and can accumulate in the body. PFAS stay in the human body for long periods of time. As a result, as people get exposed to PFAS from different sources over time, the level of PFAS in their bodies may increase to the point where they suffer from adverse health effects. Studies indicate that PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, and PFHxS can cause reproductive and developmental, liver and kidney, and immunological effects, and decreased thyroid hormone levels in laboratory animals.\u00a0 The most consistent findings from human epidemiology studies are increased cholesterol levels among exposed populations, with more limited findings related to: infant birth weights, effects on the immune system, cancer (for PFOA), and thyroid hormone disruption (for PFOS and PFBS). effects on kidneys (PFBS) growth and development in fetuses, infants, and young children (PFHxS)           4.   What are California monitoring regulations on PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, and PFHxS?      In August 2019, the Division of Drinking Water (DDW) set the customer Notification Level of 5.1 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and 6.5 ppt for PFOS and in February 2020, set new a Response Level of 10 ppt for PFOA and 40 ppt for PFOS. In March 2021, DDW issued the notification level and response level for PFBS of 500 ppt and 5000 ppt, respectively. \u00a0In October 2022, DDW issued the notification level and response level for PFHxS at 3 ppt and 20 ppt, respectively. A notification level is a nonregulatory, precautionary health-based measure for concentrations of chemicals in drinking water that warrant notification and further monitoring and assessment. A response level is a nonregulatory, precautionary health-based measure that is set higher than a notification level and represents a recommended level that water systems consider taking a water source out of service or provide treatment if available to them. In March 2019, the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) began a state-wide  PFAS investigation  and issued orders to approximately 200 water utilities throughout California to test groundwater wells that are in close proximity to fire training/fire response sites (e.g., airfields), industrial sites, landfills, and/or wastewater treatment plants for PFAS. Since ACWD groundwater sources are not located in close proximity to potential sources of contamination, ACWD was  not issued\u00a0 orders \u00a0 to monitor for PFOA, PFOS, or PFBS by  DDW . \u00a0 Assembly Bill 756 that took effect on January 1, 2020, authorized the State Board to more broadly order water systems to monitor for PFAS and report their detections. ACWD was not issued an order under the Assembly Bill. In October 2022, DDW issued monitoring orders to numerous water agencies, including ACWD, to monitor all groundwater sources effective January 1, 2023. \u00a0The provisions of the Order are similar to the voluntary monitoring program that ACWD began in June 2020. \u00a0ACWD will continue to monitor sources on a quarterly basis.           5.   Has ACWD tested its water for PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, or PFHxS?     ACWD tested drinking water supplies for PFOA and PFOS compounds in 2014, as required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule. ACWD did not detect PFOA or PFOS in the drinking water in 2014. Since 2014, advances in testing technologies since 2014 have allowed us to detect substances at increasingly low levels. Therefore, ACWD, once again, in June 2020, voluntarily sampled several water supply sources ahead of any regulatory requirement. \u00a0This proactive monitoring allows ACWD to ensure the best water quality is available to our customers and take measures to treat our source supplies. Our voluntary testing identified low levels of PFOA in our groundwater sources between non-detect and 6.4 ppt, with some sources above the customer notification level of 5.1 ppt. \u00a0 However, all treated water delivered to customers had no detections of PFOA. PFOS was detected in most groundwater sources at low levels, between non-detect and 15 ppt, with some sources above the customer notification level of 6.5 ppt set by the State Board. \u00a0 However, all treated water delivered to customers was below the notification level or non-detectable. PFBS was detected in some groundwater sources at low levels, between non-detect and 7.4 ppt,  with all sources below the customer notification level of 500 ppt. \u00a0All treated water delivered to customers had no detections of PFBS. PFHxS was detected in most groundwater sources, between non-detect and 14 ppt, with most of the sources above the customer notification level of 3 ppt.  Since the establishment of the notification level, ACWD has optimized operations to ensure all treated water delivered to customers remain below notification levels. Results from this same monitoring program did not detect PFOA, PFOS, or PFBS in surface water supplies which account for almost two-thirds of ACWD\u2019s total water delivered to our customers.           6.   How were tests conducted?      Samples were collected by trained sampling staff from locations where other regulatory water quality samples are collected and analyzed by a State Certified Laboratory.           7.   How often will ACWD monitor for PFAS?       As per the State Board Monitoring Order that was issued in October 2022 and is effective January 1, 2023, ACWD will continue the quarterly groundwater monitoring as it has been doing voluntarily since June 2020.           8.   What is ACWD doing about treatment for PFAS?       ACWD has existing water treatment facilities in place to effectively safeguard your water supply with the use of reverse osmosis technology at our Newark Desalination Facility and the blending of groundwater and surface water at our Blending Facility. Both these methods are already implemented at our treatment facilities and have managed to keep the detections below the notification levels, thereby ensuring the treated water supplied to our customers meets all health-based standards.\u00a0 Federal and State MCLs are expected for select PFAS compounds in 2023 and 2025, respectively. \u00a0In anticipation of MCL establishments, ACWD is designing and building a treatment facility to address PFAS in groundwater at our Blending Facility. \u00a0Currently in design, the facility will treat up to 6 million gallons per day (MGD) of PFAS-impacted groundwater and may be potentially expanded to treat up to 15 MGD in the future, if needed. \u00a0In addition, the facility will restore reduced capacity that resulted from operational changes needed to minimize PFAS levels in the treated water delivered to customers.           9.   How will customers be updated about future testing results?      ACWD will post PFAS sampling results on its website and additionally provide the sample results to the State Water Resources Control Board Division of Drinking Water who will also post it on their website. The latest data is available at  acwd.org/PFAS           10.   Where can I find more information?

Follow ACWD on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram  @AlamedaCountyWD  for immediate updates on when we post a new employee profile. Aaron, Construction Inspector in Developmental Services As a Construction Inspector for Developmental Services, Aaron often drives around the service area, meets with contractors and developers, and completes the proper paperwork to ensure ACWD infrastructure is up to safety and quality standards. Aaron's ability to multi-task, his first-hand experience working with underground pipelines, \u00a0and his passion for public service are valued by the District. Aaron was a heavy equipment operator and worked in construction for 10 years, following the footsteps of his father, who had a 20-plus-year career as an operator engineer. After working in construction for 10 years, Aaron sought a more fulfilling career and decided to join law enforcement as a police officer in the Hunters Point neighborhood of San Francisco, and in Berkeley. While he found working in law enforcement rewarding to help people, it was also taxing. When it came time to switch careers, Aaron knew he still wanted to be in a role where he could support the community and came across a Construction Inspector job at ACWD. Aaron explains that his journey to ACWD was unorthodox but that he's enjoyed the valleys and peaks to get to where he currently is. He will be celebrating his five years at ACWD in October 2023. Apart from his job tasks, Aaron enjoys the simple pleasures and calm moments of life, like watching his kids grow up, going on a walk, catching A's and Raiders games, and collecting baseball cards. People may not know that he's a big University of Alabama fan. His parents live near the university, and he enjoys visiting them. He expresses that the food is delicious and that the people are very hospitable.\u00a0 \"I can't say enough good things about the people at ACWD and the team I work with.

ACWD is a vital\u00a0part of its service area, and Leona is proud to share what she knows about what we do, how we do it, and why. For example, last year Leona put up a drought yard sign and replaced her lawn with low-water perennials and stone. A few of her neighbors asked about the lawn conversion and were inspired to do the same. It was special for her to know that she made an impact with the knowledge she shared. Leona expresses that life is busy with a big family, two cats and a dog. However, she enjoys reading, working in her garden and practicing new recipes, when she has spare time. One of Leona's passions is baking, and we like desserts here at ACWD; it is always fun for her to bring treats for everyone to try. \"Before working here, I never considered how water got to my kitchen sink.

She says, it\u2019s the best feeling to put a smile on a customer\u2019s face! During the COVID-19 pandemic Patty expressed how grateful she was to be able to work and provide service to ACWD customers.

He started in the Army Reserves where he was trained on electrical, refrigeration and equipment repair. After 6 years in the reserves Voltaire knew his passion was in the electrical field and wanted\u00a0to pursue it. Voltaire explains that as an Electrician you are constantly being challenged with different projects and problems and I really enjoy that part of the job. Here at ACWD, his work group consists of skilled individuals and that often collaborate on issues and come up with solutions together that are best for the District and Voltaire finds that to be very rewarding. At ACWD, Electricians install and maintain electrical equipment, power generation and emergency backup system used in water production, treatment, distribution and office facilities. They also install and maintain communication systems throughout the District as well as video surveillance, access control, life and safety systems. They\u00a0are constantly on the move! Voltaire has worked on many projects, but the Capital Improvement Project where his group replaced all of the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) at our Water Treatment Plant #2 in Fremont is by far his favorite. PLCs and related software provide behind-the-scenes control of many of our water systems\u2019 operations, you can think of them as the brains of our facilities. The electrical team had to identify thousands of wires and devices and then produce a drawing to use to build and install new panels. Once complete they had to test every valve and part to ensure it was functioning properly. The electrical team worked with a great team of ACWD engineers, instrument technicians and outside contractors to make this project a success. When he\u2019s not working, Voltaire enjoys spending time with his wife and three children. From going to sporting events to watching them perform, they are always on the go! In the future Voltaire hopes to travel more and spend more time doing photography. \"As an Electrician you are constantly being challenged with different projects and problems and I really enjoy that part of the job\" *As of 1/20 Selina, Human Resource Analyst She defines the term \u201cservice with a smile\u201d and provides excellent internal and external customer service.

That is because Mike is one of two ACWD highly skilled auto mechanics. With more than 35 years of auto mechanic experience, Mike specializes as a heavy equipment diesel mechanic.\u00a0 Mike has always enjoyed working on heavy equipment - tractors, trains, and off-road heavy equipment. Fixing things and problem solving is second nature. The work he does is behind the scenes, ensuring District vehicles are safe and equipment is reliable so field crews can do their jobs. In doing so, Mike earns their confidence, and that\u2019s important to him. Mike began his District career five years ago, and although he has extensive experience as a mechanic, the water industry was new to him. Now, he sees that even from the mechanic shop, the work he does plays a part in providing an essential service to the community of which he both works and lives in. Mike states that water is vital to life and knowing that his job helps to contribute to the service provided to the Tri-Cities is rewarding. Mike enjoys travelling with his wife and two dogs, Roxy, and Gunnar. They are explorers and love the outdoors, spending time in their camper and riding their utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) - the Mohave Desert is one of their favorite places! Mike says that Roxy is fearless, and rides along on the UTV - she loves to bark at the wind. Something most people may not know about Mike is that he cooks and gardens! Mike states that there is nothing like fresh vegetables grown in your backyard. For him, it\u2019s corn, tomatoes, squash, and cucumbers. Fresh being the best! Mike adds his homegrown tomatoes to tacos, one of his favorite foods to make. When the weekends are spent at home, you can find him smoking ribs and tri-tip, relaxing in the yard, and enjoying the comfortable Bay Area weather. A fun fact about Mike is that in May 2017, he received special recognition from the ACWD Board of Directors for a suggestion he made relating to the operations of the mechanic shop. It was a cost-saving measure and a benefit to the District. Go Mike! \"Water is vital to life and knowing that my job helps to contribute to the service provided to the Tri-Cities is rewarding.\"\u00a0 *As of 10/2018 Sharene, Senior Public Affairs Specialist As the Senior Public Affairs Specialist, Sharene helps to implement District communications and community engagement goals. She says she is fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and collaborate with all departments throughout the District. Sharene takes pride in her work knowing that water is such a n essential part of life and that she gets to share information about its importance. One of her most challenging, yet rewarding projects to date was to coordinate a volunteer effort to paint water conservation murals on District facilities along Alameda Creek. This project had detailed components and the timeline was very short, which is often the case in public affairs, but the outcome was great! ACWD staff and volunteers worked together and to this day, the murals remain an artistic way to remind us to all conserve water. Sharene\u2019s most rewarding aspect of her job is knowing that the work she does raises awareness about water, and with that, knowing that we can each have a positive impact on our environment. When she is talking with customers and children during events or tours, she gets to share in that \"ah-ha\" moment when folks learn the ripple effects of conservation, that some of their water comes from Alameda Creek watershed, or that ACWD operates a desalination facility in Newark. Recently, Sharene worked with over 200 First LEGO League Challenge participants, giving them tours of our treatment facility and discussing our treatment processes. She loves when she can be creative and take technical and complex topics like treatment and make it fun and relatable. When she sees the excitement in kids\u2019 eyes and know she sparked interest in their young minds or piqued curiosity that may evoke change - that is the real reward. In her free time, Sharene enjoys being active - hiking, practicing yoga, and taking spontaneous day trips. Sharene teaches Hot Pilates and enjoys leading her students through their wellness journey. And yet, she is also happy to relax at home, cook, and binge watch true-crime investigation shows. And what is her favorite fact about water you ask? That we drink the same water dinosaurs drink! The water cycle is an amazing thing and through its process allows water to recycle. \"When I see the excitement in kids\u2019 eyes and know that I sparked interest in their young minds or piqued curiosity that may evoke change - that is the real reward.\" *As of 08/2018 Ryan, Laboratory Technician With a curious mind and an interest in chemistry, Ryan collects samples throughout the water distribution system to ensure it remains safe to drink. Ryan says that the beauty of his job is the variation of tasks - there is field work, desk work, and la b work so he gets to mix it up, which he says he likes. When Ryan is in the field, he and the other technicians visit 53 sample points weekly. They take small collections of finished water, water that has already been treated, so that it can be tested at our state-certified lab. Ryan describes his co-workers as an extension of his family and he enjoys working with them all. Lab work requires teamwork and he is proud to be part of a great team - co-workers he considers to be friends. They each lend support to complete whatever the task is at hand, and everyone steps up to the plate regardless. Ryan says that enjoying the people you work with makes a huge difference and he says that the friendships he\u2019s made over the last four years at ACWD are the most rewarding part of his job - that it makes it easy to come to work. Due to his job, Ryan often talks with customers when he is near sampling stations. He loves that customers have questions and are truly interested in the work he does - such as, is the water safe to drink? How do you test the water? The list goes on. One day, he had a customer and his two young daughters approach him and the girls asked if he could show them \"the magic trick that makes the water change color\". What they wanted to see was how the water changes to pink during a chlorine test which indicates sufficient chlorine as been added to treat the water. Although Ryan knows the science behind the test, he says he did feel like a magician when the girls\u2019 face lit up with excitement as the beaker shifted from clear to pink. He states that their reaction was the magic. What does Ryan do outside of work? Well, Ryan feels life is best enjoyed through experiences and exploration. For him, that is travelling. He enjoys visiting new countries, experiencing the food, culture, people, and outdoor activities. His favorite vacation destination to date has been Thailand - he loved it. As a Bay Area native, Ryan likes to escape to warm climates that are best suited for the activities he enjoys most - hiking, snorkeling, and riding ATV\u2019s. Ryan\u2019s future plans include visiting Vietnam, Japan, and the Philippines. But, he says all of that in due time; he\u2019s saving up - it\u2019s all a balance. When it comes to his curious side, Ryan says his super power of choice would be teleportation because he could get anywhere in 10 seconds. With that, it sounds like Ryan could start checking off his vacation destinations. \"Their reaction was the magic.\" *As of 08/2018 David, Utility Worker III If a customer calls our emergency hotline to report a leak, a water pressure  issue, or other emergency, chances are David will be the first responder. With more than 20 years on the job, David, a Utility Worker III and Newark native is committed to providing excellent customer service with prompt assessments of emergencies and other \u00a0customer needs. Whether it\u2019s as simple as replacing a broken water meter lid, or as critical as a full-scale main rupture, David is prepared to control the incident through his years of experience and training received in the Incident Command System (ICS). His vital role as the first on scene incident commander, assure customers will get their water back in service in a timely manner. On any given day, David may respond to as many as 20 calls. A customer\u2019s water service may be interrupted, and quickly identifying the cause for water loss is important. Their response time is typically less than one hour, with more rapid response for critical safety and property damage emergencies. Quick action not only gets the customers back in service but reduces water waste that may be caused by leaks or a broken water line. Because safety is a priority, David\u2019s role in contacting Underground Service Alert (USA) to identify other underground utilities is particularly important. \"When making water main repairs, we want to ensure gas, electric, and sewer, communication lines, are properly marked to beginning repair work to ensure safety of those on scene.\" \u00a0In working with potable water distribution lines, it\u2019s critical to follow proper regulatory protocol. David possesses a State Water Resources Control Board Distribution II certification; this demonstrates his knowledge, skills, and ability to meet regulatory standards. He is also certified to operate a backhoe. In fact, David notes, \"Through my 20 years\u2019 experience, I have become very proficient.\" \u00a0Having had a lengthy career with the District, David\u2019s biggest professional accomplishment was back in 2006, ACWD had sent him and five others to provide mutual aid in recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina, \"witnessing firsthand devastation and disaster was humbling and something I\u2019ll never forget.\" They worked from sunrise to sunset for 12 straight days to help restore water service. \"We lost count of how many repairs were made, but knowing I was able to help during that crisis- that is my biggest professional accomplishment.\" *As of 04/2017 Jason, Water Controller I \u00a0M eet Jason, he\u2019s been with ACWD since July 6, 1998! During his time here, he\u2019s had the opportunity to hold three different positions, which have given him the chance to learn, grow, and be promoted within the agency. As a water controller, he is involved in a host of activities along Alameda Creek and our watershed.\u00a0What Jason find most rewarding, but challenging, is predicting rainfall amounts and projected flow rates that help us make decisions on how to effectively capture as much water as is needed. In addition to these responsibilities, Jason may interact with 10-15 members of the public, with that, he keeps his customer service philosophy simple: \"treat others as I like to be treated\". Because he interacts regularly with customers, it gives him an opportunity to explain ACWD\u2019s operations to the public so you can understand how we optimize water flows, while meeting regulations. One of his most interesting experiences on the job occurred along Alameda Creek, when he saw a bald eagle cruising above the creek bed near Niles. Having lived around Fremont for more than 35 years, Jason never expected to see a bald eagle. He states, \"That was a great day at work\"! \"Water is such an important resource and being able to be a part of providing it to our customers is an honor.\"\u00a0 *As of 04/2017 David, Customer Account Field Representative Sometimes while working with ACWD, we may have employees that don\u2019t just have one\u00a0 duty; instead they may perform a\u00a0 multitude of tasks. These skills are highly valuable because it allows our staff to be extremely flexible and able to assist each other in d ifferent areas. With 15 years of service and countless hours walked to provide meter reading and customer service, we are pleased to introduce David, our Customer Account Field Representative. David wears several hats in his role, these include: meter reading, collections, turning service on and off, in-office customer service support, and he also serves on the Safety Committee. Before starting his career with ACWD, David worked in retail management and the technology industry. But when the tech industry took a turn, he decided with his background in customer service and interest in giving back to the community, that he truly wanted a career in public service. What David finds most rewarding in helping customers is since he is in the field all day; he may be the only interaction our customers have with the District. He\u2019s had several instances when reading a meter and customers come out to talk with him. David uses that opportunity to show them how to read their meter as well as check for leaks. David states that there was one particularly challenging day where, \"I was on a route and got caught in a rain and lightning storm and all I could think about was, \u2019I\u2019m in a lightning storm walking around with a metal stick.\u2019 The stick is a meter reading stick used to manipulate meter lids.\" He brings this story up to point out that people have the misconception that his job entails only walking to read meters. That said, he\u2019s out in 100 degree temperatures or when it\u2019s cold and rainy. Add to that, the hazards of dog bites, vehicle traffic, and the physical demands of walking 8 miles a day year after year- it\u2019s a lot more than just walking. But David takes pride in what he does knowing our customers deserve the best possible service. \"Each duty has its benefits and challenges but I enjoy my work most when I\u2019m able to help customers.\" *As of 04/2017 Sylvia, Treatment Facility Operator In our mission to provide clean, safe, and reliable drinking water at a reasonable\u00a0 price, we are pleased to introduce our employees  who work to ensure this happens. Meet Sylvia, a treatment facility operator who\u00a0uses her training, knowledge, and experience to safeguard your drinking water supply.\u00a0 \u00a0 Sylvia\u2019s career in water operations began in 2005 while working for another municipality. She began learning about water main installations, and as her fascination grew, she wanted to grow with and contribute to an organization. Sylvia joined ACWD in 2008 and hasn\u2019t looked back. Over the years, she has obtained, and currently possesses, three State of California certifications, including: American Water Works Association Water Quality Analyst Grade 2; Water Distribution Operator Grade 3; and a Water Treatment Operator Grade 3. In order for Sylvia to prepare to operate a water treatment facility, certifications and ongoing training is key. Water treatment operators are responsible for public health and safety, and providing water that meets or exceeds state and federal regulations is a priority. She states, \"It is equally important to have both a high level of skill and the knowledge necessary to take charge of operating a water treatment facility.\" They are trained to act quickly and to be responsive in the event of unplanned situations which are key in delivering an uninterrupted water supply. As a treatment facility operator, Sylvia and the other operator\u2019s decisions directly impact the quality and quantity of the drinking water delivered to our customers. Speaking of community, Sylvia notes, \"ACWD demonstrates community involvement in many ways; one is by sponsoring an employee a year to participate in the Fremont Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Leadership Fremont Program.\" Sylvia happily represented ACWD in 2015 and says, \"I gained personal and professional growth through my participation.\" Most recently, she participated in the Tri-City Health Center\u2019s Superhero Run. \"I\u2019m proud to be part of an organization that delivers such an important and necessary resource to the community.\" *As of 04/2017 Monica, Customer Account Representative\u00a0 At ACWD, we work to provide excellent customer service and are here to answer questions you may have. Monica, a customer account representative, interfaces with hundreds of customers each week and is dedicated to delivering superior service when it matters most. Although the tasks Monica completes each day are typical, no two days are the same. When working with customers, she is addressing a range of questions, inquiries, or concerns - this may be done in person, online, or over the phone. One customer may call to begin or cancel service while another may want to learn more about drought restrictions or conservation incentives and rebates. She always enjoys sharing conservation tips and informing customers about the resources available to help reduce water use or lower their bill. When Monica is not interfacing one-on-one with customers, she works to resolve billing issues, \"I enjoy research and problem solving to provide a resolution.\" Being in customer service requires vast knowledge of a variety of topics - billing and conservation to name a few. Monica came into this position with a Bachelor of Science degree and has over 25 years of experience working in the private and public sector. She has been with ACWD since 2009, during which time; her topics of interest have evolved. In order to be successful at her job, Monica keeps up to date with rates and billing information, customer consumption, conservation, and the District\u2019s mandatory water use restrictions. Monica notes, \"It\u2019s important to stay abreast of these topics to best help our customers.\" Since customer service professionals are in high demand, Monica chose ACWD when a family friend, who had retired from the District, told her about a job opportunity. Having spent the majority of her career working in customer service, she was, \"excited to join an agency with a stellar reputation.\" \"I enjoy working with people on a one-on-one basis and find it rewarding to help customers.\" *As of 04/2017 Ranga, Groundwater Resources Engineer With nearly 40 percent of our water supply coming from local groundwater, the\u00a0 monitoring and protection of our underground reservoir is essential. Ranga, groundwater resources engineer, is part of a team that helps protect and manage this critically important local resource. Ranga joined the District in 2003 because it allows him to make an effective contribution to groundw ater protection at the local level. As a resident of Fremont, he uses his skills and advanced degree in civil and environmental engineering to do work that directly impact his community. His professional certifications include: registered professional engineer; water distribution and water treatment operator certifications. Because of his interest in technology, he\u2019s also obtained a certificate in information systems from UC Berkeley. Although Ranga wears multiple hats, his current concentration is overseeing 32 sites for soil and groundwater restoration - restoration from pollution from underground fuel tank sites and large manufacturing industries. A handful of these are land restoration projects, where former industrial sites that are vacant and are being developed. Overall, his role is divided into four primary functions: a regulator for groundwater; reclamation of the groundwater basin from historical saltwater intrusion; managing the groundwater replenishment assessment; and serving on the District\u2019s Information Systems Technical Advisory Committee. Each year, as he promotes Groundwater Awareness Week, Ranga has the opportunity to bring science into area high schools with a presentation that includes a hands-on groundwater model that demonstrates the effects of pollution. Outside of work, Ranga is an active scout parent who loves to spend time with his family exploring outdoors, \"I enjoy traveling with my family, cooking, tinkering with gadgets, and learning new technology.\" \"I enjoy teaching as it allows me to engage and motivate young minds.\" *As of 04/2017                                                ACWD History           Chronology of Significant Events           Fact Sheet           Plans, Reports, & Studies           News Releases           The ACWD Connection           The People of ACWD                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

What is the difference between hard and soft water?    Put quite simply, hard water has more minerals in it than soft water. Calcium carbonate is the mineral most commonly associated with water hardness. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold by your local drug or health food store. Hard water reduces the \u201csudsing\u201d ability of soap and causes the spots on your dishes and glasses after washing and air-drying.  \t\t\t         2.   What is the white residue I find at the bottom of my pots and tea kettle, and around my faucet fixtures? What can I do to get rid of it?    The white residue is calcium carbonate. There are cleaning products on the market made specifically for its removal. A \u201cgreen\u201d alternative for removing hardness residue is warm vinegar. Add \u00bd cup of white distilled vinegar to the tea kettle or pot, fill with water, and let sit overnight. Persistent residue can be removed by warming vinegar in the kettle or pot, cooling, and rinsing well afterwards.\t\t\t More information about removing calcium carbonate           3.   Is calcium carbonate bad for me?    No, calcium carbonate is an essential nutrient that is used by your body to fortify bones and teeth. It also helps your muscles to function properly.\t\t\t         4.   What is my water hardness in grains/gallon?    In most cases, water quality parameters are reported in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L).  To convert hardness in ppm (or mg/L) to grains per gallon (gpg), simply divide by 17.1.  For example, water hardness of 100 ppm equals 100/17.1 or 5.85 gpg.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

What is the difference between hard and soft water?    Put quite simply, hard water has more minerals in it than soft water. Calcium carbonate is the mineral most commonly associated with water hardness. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold by your local drug or health food store. Hard water reduces the \u201csudsing\u201d ability of soap and causes the spots on your dishes and glasses after washing and air-drying.  \t\t\t         2.   What is the white residue I find at the bottom of my pots and tea kettle, and around my faucet fixtures? What can I do to get rid of it?    The white residue is calcium carbonate. There are cleaning products on the market made specifically for its removal. A \u201cgreen\u201d alternative for removing hardness residue is warm vinegar. Add \u00bd cup of white distilled vinegar to the tea kettle or pot, fill with water, and let sit overnight. Persistent residue can be removed by warming vinegar in the kettle or pot, cooling, and rinsing well afterwards.\t\t\t More information about removing calcium carbonate           3.   Is calcium carbonate bad for me?    No, calcium carbonate is an essential nutrient that is used by your body to fortify bones and teeth. It also helps your muscles to function properly.\t\t\t         4.   What is my water hardness in grains/gallon?    In most cases, water quality parameters are reported in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L).  To convert hardness in ppm (or mg/L) to grains per gallon (gpg), simply divide by 17.1.  For example, water hardness of 100 ppm equals 100/17.1 or 5.85 gpg.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Home About Us Water Quality Understanding PFAS                         Understanding PFAS\t\t               ACWD Is Committed to Monitoring for PFAS (Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances)\u00a0 Per \u2013 and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) In recent years, people have become more familiar with the term PFAS. PFAS are manmade compounds that have been used to make carpets, clothing, fabrics for furniture, paper packaging for food, electronics, personal hygiene products, and other materials (e.g., cookware) designed to be waterproof, stain-resistant, or non-stick. Of particular interest are four compounds that have Notification Levels. Perfluorooctanoic Acid, more commonly referred to as PFOA, Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid, or PFOS, Perfluorobutane Sulfonic Acid or PFBS, and Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid or PFHxS. Notification levels are health-based advisory levels established by the State Water Resource Control Board Division of Drinking Water for contaminants that may be regulated in the future. Used in many consumer and industrial products for their ability to repel stains, water, and oil, PFAS are persistent in the environment and do not readily degrade. They have been in use since the 1940s and are prevalent in many items we encounter daily \u2013 inside and outside the home. While items imported from outside the United States may contain PFAS, its use is being phased out in the US. \u00a0 Find more information on ACWD\u2019s proactive approach to detect PFAS in the water supply in our  PFAS Fact Sheet .                        Identifying sources of PFAS is critical to water quality \u00a0\u00a0 Water agencies across the country are working to identify sources and treatment of PFAS in water supplies. \u00a0Water source supplies vary throughout the country, state and region with the most common sources of water being surface water and groundwater. In March 2019, the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) began a state-wide PFAS investigation and issued orders to approximately 200 water utilities throughout California to test groundwater wells that are in close proximity to fire training/fire response sites (e.g., airfields), industrial sites, landfills, and/or wastewater treatment plants for PFAS. Since ACWD groundwater sources are not located near potential sources of contamination, ACWD was  not issued  orders to monitor for PFAS by the State Board at that time. In March 2020, ACWD elected to undertake a voluntary sampling program starting in June 2020, to monitor for the presence of PFAS in groundwater and surface water sources and the treated water being provided to our customers. Effective January 1, 2023, ACWD received monitoring orders by the State Board to monitor for PFAS compounds on a quarterly basis in all source groundwater. \u00a0The voluntary monitoring conducted since June 2020 meets all the requirements of this order and ACWD will continue its regular quarterly monitoring. \u00a0Data will continue to be posted on the website. ACWD\u2019s proactive approach to PFAS The Alameda County Water District is committed to delivering high-quality drinking water to our customers. This commitment included a voluntary approach to monitoring drinking water for PFAS, prior to being issued monitoring orders by the Division of Drinking Water. Our findings from the PFAS monitoring confirm that no ACWD customers are receiving water with concentrations of PFOS/PFOA, PFBS, or PFHxS above the notification levels and meets all state and federal drinking water quality standards. View the detailed results of the  April 2022 through March 2023  PFAS compounds with notification levels. View  all  detailed results of the  April 2022 through March 2023  PFAS compounds. ACWD\u2019s diverse water supply improves water quality, reliability, and flexibility ACWD has a unique and diverse water supply. This diversity allows for operational adjustments to maximize water quality and reliability. \u00a0 The threat of contamination, a natural disaster or drought are some potential risks to our water supply. That is why we continuously take steps to identify, reduce or mitigate these risks and are prepared to adapt operations when needed. Our customers can rest assured your water is available and meets or exceeds all state and federal drinking water standards. Find out more information on ACWD\u2019s  water supply sources .

Combined, these two mandates require the\u00a0testing of lead levels of drinking water at\u00a0California K-12 public schools, preschools,\u00a0and child day\u00a0care facilities located on public school property constructed before January 1, 2010.

Home About Us Water Quality Main Cleaning How the Main Cleaning Program Works                         How the Main Cleaning Program Works\t\t               ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. Main cleaning may result in a brief period of discolored tap water for some Tri-City residents from January-June. Despite its appearance, the water remains safe for household uses such as drinking and cooking. ACWD recommends minimizing water use and avoid washing light-colored laundry from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the day or week main cleaning is scheduled for your neighborhood.\u00a0 \u00a0 For additional information, please visit  acwd.org/maincleaning  or contact the Operations Department administrative group at (510) 668-6500, Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Evaluation of Recapture Options Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for the main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it's just not technically feasible. To clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at remarkably high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The number of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of the State-required processes.

Home About Us Water Quality Main Cleaning                         Main Cleaning\t\t               2024 Main Cleaning Schedule The Alameda County Water District (ACWD) is scheduled to clean select water mains and all dead end mains in the cities of Fremont, Newark, and Union City to improve water quality and remove sediment buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is part of the vital service provided by ACWD to ensure that all customers receive high quality water. Cleaning will occur from January 2024 through June 2024; Monday through Friday, 7 AM to 4 PM (excluding holidays). \u00a0Note that the cleaning schedule is subject to change.\u00a0 Please note  that there may be sediments stirred up in the water during or immediately after the cleaning event, giving the water a cloudy or discolored appearance. The water continues to meet all state and federal Drinking Water Standards for public health and safety (see  discolored water FAQs ). Residents may experience discolored water on streets or cul-de-sacs if the surrounding areas are being cleaned. Despite its appearance, discolored water does not indicate that the integrity of the water main has been compromised. A disinfectant residual is always maintained to ensure that the water continues to meet all state and federal health-based Drinking Water Standards. Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population such as immunocompromised persons, some elderly, and infants. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers.\u00a0 Please minimize water use and avoid washing light-colored laundry from 7 AM to 4 PM on the day main cleaning is scheduled or if discolored water is noticed. You can  Click Here  to find out if your street will be cleaned this year\u00a0 Type your street address in the search box Click on your street name and a dialog box will display the date of water main cleaning. You can also search the street lists below, they are sorted alphabetically by street name for each city. Access a list of streets being cleaned in the city of Fremont Access a list of streets being cleaned in the city of Newark Access a list of streets being cleaned in the city of Union City Access a list of streets being cleaned in ACWD's service area by date Tip:  To search for your street, on your keyboard press Ctrl+F and type your street name into the search box; then press 'Next'. If your street is scheduled to be cleaned this year, the street name will be highlighted. Please note that the flushing dates may be subject to change due to system operations. For further program information please contact the Operations Department administrative staff at  (510) 668-6500; Monday - Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM . ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible. To clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at remarkably high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The number of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming, inefficient, and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. Helpful Tips for Home: To minimize discolored water: Refrain from water use while main cleaning is in progress in your neighborhood. Wait an hour after street operations have ceased before using your taps to let normal flow patterns re-establish themselves. To clear discolored water from your plumbing: Run the cold water faucet of your bathtub or other unscreened tap for 2-3 minutes until the water runs clear. If the water does not clear, turn off your faucet and wait an hour before repeating the process.
