A format for content distribution, RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication. RSS is a system that allows a user to get automatic updates from multiple websites whenever new content is published on these sites. It acts like a personal web reader by checking your selected sites regularly for new content. If you set up an RSS feed from the New York Times Sports section, for example, you would be notified whenever a new article was posted. The notification takes place in an RSS Reader. How do I start using RSS Feeds? To use a site\u2019s RSS feature, an RSS reader is required. Choose an RSS reader. An internet search will return many options. Some readers are web-based, such as  My Yahoo! . Web-based readers require no software installation and are accessible from any computer that has internet access. Other readers are downloadable applications, such as   FeedDemon . Once you\u2019ve chosen an RSS reader, follow the instructions to download, install, and open the reader. Decide what type of content you want the RSS reader to monitor. Many websites provide RSS, which can usually be found on those sites as a link. An orange button is often used to display the service\u2019s availability. Sometimes the RSS feed is automatically added to the RSS reader and updates are sent every time new content is available. Alternatively, you may have to click the RSS link and copy it into your RSS reader.   \u25b2\u00a0Back to top            Live Edit                                    About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Home About Us Customer Service Detect a Water Leak Possible Leak Causes                         Possible Leak Causes\t\t               Faucets Faucet leaks are usually caused by worn washers or \"O\" rings (for washerless faucets). To repair, turn off the water supply line to that faucet, replace the washer and turn on the line again. Toilets To determine if your toilet is leaking, look at the toilet bowl after the tank has stopped filling. If the water is still running into the bowl, or if you can hear water running, your toilet is leaking. If you do not see or hear water running, your toilet may have a silent leak. To test for a silent leak, drop a little food coloring into the tank. Do not flush. Wait for about 20 minutes. If the food coloring appears in the toilet bowl, your toilet has a silent leak. It is probably located in or around the plunger ball or flapper valve at the bottom of the tank. These leaks are easy to fix with parts from your hardware or home store. Irrigation Systems There are a number of ways to determine if your irrigation system is leaking. Taller, greener vegetation or moss growing around the sprinkler heads are signs of a damaged or dirty valve. Clean grit from valves and replace worn gaskets or seals. Wet spots, mud, and eroding soil may indicate a broken pipe or riser. Dry spots in your lawn could also be a sign that a sprinkler is damaged. To locate the source of the leak, you'll need to dig around the sprinkler. Wet spots or muddy areas around the valves point to a loose connection or aging washers. Wet spots on pavement also indicate possible leaks. Watch your sprinklers in action to determine which one is showering on the pavement. Then turn off the water and check the sprinkler head and riser. Sprinklers sprouting geysers of water indicate broken sprinkler heads. Replace them. Other Possible Culprits A warm or hot spot on your floor, combined with an increase in your natural gas bill, could indicate a broken hot water pipe in the concrete slab beneath your home. If this is the case, you will probably need to call a plumber to reroute the pipes. Check outside taps for leaking water, particularly during the summer watering season. A hose mistakenly left dribbling away on the grass or garden can waste thousands of gallons of water over the course of the summer.

Home About Us Customer Service Detect a Water Leak                         Detect a Water Leak\t\t               Determine If You Have A Leak If you suspect a water leak and you have a new smart water meter, one of the easiest ways to detect leaks is to login to ACWD\u2019s My Smart Water Connect online portal to see if there are any alerts or unexpected consumption. (You will be able to tell if you have a smart meter if the meter box lid is plastic, or you see a 3-inch black circle in the lid. Please do not attempt to lift the lid as this may damage the wiring.) \u00a0 If you have a meter that has been upgraded to a new smart water meter, instructions on how to check for leaks can be found  here .\u00a0 If you have a meter that has not yet been upgraded, one option is to observe your water meter. Turn off all faucets and water-using appliances, such as the ice maker, dishwasher and clothes washer. Locate your water meter (PDF)  and lift the cover to see the meter dial. Lift the lid carefully in case you have had a smart meter installed as the wiring may get damaged with excessive force. If you see a wire connecting the meter to an endpoint (transmitter), carefully replace the lid and login to ACWD\u2019s My Smart Water Connect online portal where you can see your consumption and any alerts. If the needle is moving, you may have a leak. If the needle appears to be still, record the meter reading or mark the needle position with a pencil or piece of tape. Keep the water off. Wait at least 15-30 minutes. (Make sure nobody turns on a water-using appliance). Reread the meter gauge or check the needle location again. If the needle has moved, you could possibly have a leak somewhere in your system. Determine If Your Leak Is Inside Or Outside Your House First, determine you have a leak using the steps outlined above. If you have a leak, follow these steps. Shut off the main water valve  to the inside of your house. Return to the water meter and lift the cover to see the meter dial. If the needle appears to be still, record the meter reading or mark the needle position with a pencil or piece of tape. Keep the water off. Wait at least 15-30 minutes.

The District's Procurement and Contracts issues solicitations to purchase materials, supplies, equipment and services estimated to cost more than $10,000 through the website. Please select one or more categories pertaining to your area(s) of interest when registering. Vendors will receive an email notifying them of the issuance of an Invitation For Bid or Request For Proposal based on the categories selected during registration. Please be sure to submit a monitored email address or register more than one individual to prevent missed business opportunities if one of the individuals is out of the office. Capital Improvement Project solicitations are issued by the Engineering and Information Technology Services Department and are available here:  Capital Improvement Projects Invitation for Bids \u00a0A formal competitive solicitation process known as an Invitation For Bid or IFB is used to procure materials, supplies and equipment estimated in value to be greater than $25,000. IFBs, which may offer a pre-bid meeting and the opportunity to seek clarification, contain exact specifications and are awarded to the bidder who offers the lowest price. Bids must be submitted in a sealed package marked with the bid number by the date and time specified in the IFB. Late bids will not be accepted and shall be returned unopened to the sender. All IFBs greater than $25,000 are open to the public; IFBs greater than $100,000 in cost require approval of award by the Board of Directors. Either a purchase order or contract will be issued to the responsive bidder. Reverse IFBs are issued periodically via email or the website to offer surplus materials/equipment to the marketplace. Such materials may include scrap metal, including brass water meters, and other equipment that is functional but has been declared as surplus. Reverse IFBs seek the highest price to be paid to the District. Site visits are typically offered for interested vendors to evaluate the products or materials prior to the deadline for bid submittal. The District's Reverse IFB will state the time allowed to remove the items and the manner of payment for them. \u00a0Requests for Proposals \u00a0A Request for Proposal (RFP) may be used to enter into contracts for professional or technical services. This competitive solicitation type may be issued formally via the District's website when the solicitation is estimated to be greater than $25,000. A pre-proposal meeting and opportunity for prospective vendors to ask questions are typically offered as part of the process. Contracts resulting from RFPs are awarded based on an evaluation of established criteria, such as approach to the scope of services and the proposer's relevant experience and expertise. Contracts resulting from a RFP are not awarded on cost alone. Contract terms may range from single to multiple years for services or for the specific duration of a project. Approval of award by the Board of Directors is required for contracts greater than $100,000.\u00a0 Requests for Quotations A Request for Quotation is used primarily for purchases of goods, materials, supplies, equipment and services estimated in value to be between $10,000 and $25,000. The District will email the RFQ to all vendors known to carry the requested products or with the expertise to provide the services. A purchase order or contract will be issued to the vendor who responds by the RFQ's established deadline with the lowest price and most favorable delivery term. For purchases less than $10,000, at least one verbal or written quotation is required, however; three q uotations for cost comparison, \u00a0when applicable, is preferred. \u00a0Award will be made to the vendor that offers the lowest price and most favorable delivery term or response time. A purchase order or credit card may be used to place the order. Equal Opportunity It is the policy of the District that all businesses be provided equal access to participate in the performance of all District contract and leasing opportunities. Sales/Use Tax The District is not exempt from sales/use tax and will pay the California Sales or Use Tax as applicable.

ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.                 \u25bc  Customers - Customer Service\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself.

What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.  The District charges fees for these and other services so the applicable party pays for these costs instead of the general District ratepayer.  While many District fees are designed to recover the full cost the activity, the new $20 field charges for door tags and shutoff are less than the District\u2019s full cost.  Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?     The Alameda County Water District has a long-term financial obligation as a member of the State Water Project and collects a portion of its state water costs on the property tax bill. The amounts collected are adjusted each year based on the District\u2019s state water costs. The State Water Project provides about 40% of the District\u2019s water supply in a typical year.

The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t               \u25bc  Customers - Customer Service\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption.

The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.           4.   What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?

A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t               \u25bc  Customers - Customer Service\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise.

What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.           4.   What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.  The District charges fees for these and other services so the applicable party pays for these costs instead of the general District ratepayer.  While many District fees are designed to recover the full cost the activity, the new $20 field charges for door tags and shutoff are less than the District\u2019s full cost.  Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?     The Alameda County Water District has a long-term financial obligation as a member of the State Water Project and collects a portion of its state water costs on the property tax bill. The amounts collected are adjusted each year based on the District\u2019s state water costs. The State Water Project provides about 40% of the District\u2019s water supply in a typical year.
