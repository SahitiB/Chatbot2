What is the purpose of the Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Program?     The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program is part of the Alameda County Water District\u2019s (District) commitment to delivering reliable drinking water supplies to more than 356,000 people living and working in Fremont, Newark and Union City. The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program will help improve water supply reliability for ACWD customers in the event of a major earthquake and will reduce service interruptions due to aging pipelines. Generally, pipelines have a lifespan of about 75 years, but the risk of a pipeline\u2019s failure increases in proportion with its age. With twenty percent of the District\u2019s pipelines installed before 1960, and the oldest pipelines placed underground in the 1940s, this project represents a major infrastructure improvement for more than 84,000 customers who depend upon reliable water supplies. Proactive pipeline upgrades protect the District and its customers from expensive fixes caused by leaks in the system.           2.   How can I stay up to date on the construction schedule?     The District is prioritizing construction sites in order of risk and project complexity within the overall program budget. Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.           3.   Why are the construction projects spread over multiple years?     All of ACWD\u2019s construction activities must comply with specific permit requirements and must take into account weather conditions and safety precautions. The staggered nature of the construction helps the District maintain reasonable working hours and reduce inconveniences to the public associated with very early and very late construction working hours.           4.   Who is paying for these projects?     The residents and businesses of Fremont, Newark, and Union City who, as ratepayers, contribute to these projects. We want to ensure our customers are aware of how their rate dollars are being used to improve water supply reliability and protect public health and safety. The costs for these projects are being funded in two ways: \u2022 Project costs have been factored into existing rate structures. \u2022 In 2012 ACWD successfully issued $45.2 million in Water Revenue Bonds to restructure existing debt at reduced interest rates and to help finance critical capital projects. By doing so, we are able to make investments in infrastructure while leveraging the District\u2019s excellent AAA bond rating and take advantage of historic low interest rates.           5.   How are you managing construction traffic?      The District is requiring its contractors to ensure that construction traffic is managed effectively and that truck traffic follows posted speed limits. We will have inspectors evaluating the project sites to ensure that rules are enforced and will address any issues that arise.           6.   How will you ensure safety at project sites during construction?     The District will ensure its contractors take precautions to ensure safety during construction, including installing barriers along construction routes, restricting travel speeds and implementing construction safety monitoring during all work. The District will provide project oversight and review during every stage of construction to ensure safety and design requirements are met, including the avoidance of gas lines and other pipelines. In the event of an emergency, the District will implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of surrounding residents, businesses and construction crews.           7.   Will the quality of the water delivered to my home be affected?     The District is committed to monitoring and ensuring water quality standards at all times. During construction, water pipelines may need to be temporarily isolated to accommodate improvements. This action may cause reverse flows in the pipeline, causing iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the pipeline to be stirred up, resulting in discolored water. However, water will remain safe to drink and continue to meet all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears. Please visit ACWD\u2019s website at www.acwd.org to learn how to flush the pipes in your home to remove the discoloration.

We are proud of the dedicated, knowledgeable and skilled professionals who are committed to our customers and the services we provide. Here, we have the chance to introduce you to just a few! Follow ACWD on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram  @AlamedaCountyWD  for immediate updates on when we post a new employee profile. Aaron, Construction Inspector in Developmental Services As a Construction Inspector for Developmental Services, Aaron often drives around the service area, meets with contractors and developers, and completes the proper paperwork to ensure ACWD infrastructure is up to safety and quality standards. Aaron's ability to multi-task, his first-hand experience working with underground pipelines, \u00a0and his passion for public service are valued by the District. Aaron was a heavy equipment operator and worked in construction for 10 years, following the footsteps of his father, who had a 20-plus-year career as an operator engineer. After working in construction for 10 years, Aaron sought a more fulfilling career and decided to join law enforcement as a police officer in the Hunters Point neighborhood of San Francisco, and in Berkeley. While he found working in law enforcement rewarding to help people, it was also taxing. When it came time to switch careers, Aaron knew he still wanted to be in a role where he could support the community and came across a Construction Inspector job at ACWD. Aaron explains that his journey to ACWD was unorthodox but that he's enjoyed the valleys and peaks to get to where he currently is. He will be celebrating his five years at ACWD in October 2023. Apart from his job tasks, Aaron enjoys the simple pleasures and calm moments of life, like watching his kids grow up, going on a walk, catching A's and Raiders games, and collecting baseball cards. People may not know that he's a big University of Alabama fan. His parents live near the university, and he enjoys visiting them. He expresses that the food is delicious and that the people are very hospitable.\u00a0 \"I can't say enough good things about the people at ACWD and the team I work with. Whenever I have a question, the engineers in Developmental Services are there to help. We are constantly working together to problem-solve and review specs for best practices.\" *as of 9/23 Leona, Accounting Technician As an Accounting Technician, Leona has supported payroll, accounts receivable and accounts payable during her tenure. Leona continues to ensure that ACWD stays fiscally responsible with her keen eye for detail, checking numbers for exact matches and properly recording documentation within financial regulations for audits. \u00a0 Leona joined the District nearly eight years ago. Her career in accounting began as a Personal Financial Records Clerk in the United States Marine Corps. This training led her to a position at a large semiconductor company as a Staff Accountant, where she was encouraged to obtain her business degree. After attending part-time night school while working, she graduated and took a hiatus from work to raise her children. When Leona returned to work, she found a home at ACWD. \u00a0 Apart from her job tasks, Leona enjoys volunteering for public outreach events hosted by the District. ACWD is a vital\u00a0part of its service area, and Leona is proud to share what she knows about what we do, how we do it, and why. For example, last year Leona put up a drought yard sign and replaced her lawn with low-water perennials and stone. A few of her neighbors asked about the lawn conversion and were inspired to do the same. It was special for her to know that she made an impact with the knowledge she shared. Leona expresses that life is busy with a big family, two cats and a dog. However, she enjoys reading, working in her garden and practicing new recipes, when she has spare time. One of Leona's passions is baking, and we like desserts here at ACWD; it is always fun for her to bring treats for everyone to try. \"Before working here, I never considered how water got to my kitchen sink. Now, I can appreciate all the contributions that make it happen. Plus, my coworkers are always willing to lend a helping hand, and it's great to be on a team you can laugh with.\" *as of 5/23 Paul, Information Technology Analyst 2 Paul, our Information Technology Analyst for Network and Cybersecurity, is charged with shielding ACWD\u2019s computer networks from cyberattacks. He navigates complex IT infrastructure to protect ACWD\u2019s internet-connected system. Apart from his role as an ACWD cyber sentry on weekdays, Paul is a real Renaissance man \u2013 going ballroom dancing with his partner on weekends, hunting for gold off Highway 49 or behind a lathe crafting fine woodworking projects.\u00a0 Paul was a heavy equipment operator (Local 3), over the road truck driver, a carpenter, and even studied to be an airline pilot while in the San Jose State University Air Force ROTC. Although he very much enjoyed being an Operator, Paul was inspired by a former co-worker to return to school and learn Computing/Networking. This led him to find a \u201cDot-Com\u201d job in the late \u201890s and gain experience that prepared Paul for his current position at ACWD. In his career at ACWD, Paul is most proud of leading four Red Cross blood drives at ACWD. It\u2019s a Districtwide event at our main office that makes it easy for any employee to participate \u2013 donating blood is the gift of life. He is now coordinating a blood drive for July 2023. \u00a0 Paul enjoys working with the ACWD staff and seeing them go through stages of life - becoming expectant mothers, babies being proudly shown for the first time, or hearing stories of how kids are growing up. He also enjoys the off-hour employee events open to families, including holiday parties, BBQs and other celebrations. In addition, when a societal or water emergency arises, ACWD is ready with well-qualified teams and resources to resolve the incident quickly. Paul is proud to be a supportive part of the quick response day or night. \"Currently, most of my work is related to cybersecurity; it\u2019s enjoyable because we have a tightly woven IT team. It is rewarding to work together with the same goal of having an impervious networked \u201cwall\u201d protecting the staff and systems inside. \" *as of 3/23 Marian, Administrative Assistant/Assistant District Secretary As the Administrative Assistant/Assistant District Secretary for the Office of the General Manager, Marian supports ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors, General Manager, and District Secretary by coordinating board and committee meetings, handling requests for public rec ords, and other administrative tasks. After working in various positions in the South Bay and enduring a long commute and hours in a fast-paced environment, Marian wanted a job closer to her home in Fremont. Marian got her wish when she hired at ACWD as an Office Assistant in the Engineering Department. Her role continued to evolve to include a current position with the Office of the General Manager.  \u00a0 Marian has enjoyed contributing to significant department-process upgrades as ACWD has adapted to advancing technology, especially in the transition from paper to digital files. Sharing her institutional knowledge has been especially helpful in retaining best practices while moving processes forward. Years ago, Marian had the opportunity to write an article for ACWD published in the Tri-City Voice. It rekindled Marian's passion for writing and sparked her journey as an author and illustrator for a series of children\u2019s books \u2013 \u201cThe Brotherhood of Dragons.\u201d As she ventured into self-publishing, Marian did classroom readings and created promotional stickers and a dragon hand puppet.\u00a0 \"It is rewarding to find ways to fine-tune business processes and apply my technical and creative skills in providing administrative support. I am fortunate to work alongside a community of professionals passionate about their work and am continually amazed to see the depth of knowledge exhibited by our staff and board members.\" \u00a0*as of 11/22 Cynthia, Environmental Engineer\u00a0 Cynthia is a Bay Area resident living and working in the city of Fremont! Responsible for several programs, Cynthia knows the importance\u00a0of delivering water quality good for the entire community. When she is not working, Cynthia loves spending time outdoors with her kids, whether at the park or on a hike! Working as an Environmental Engineer with ACWD since July 2012, Cynthia is currently an Associate Engineer. Her responsibilities include providing quality drinking water to customers by ensuring it meets or exceeds state and federal drinking water standards, including regulatory compliance, conducting water quality studies, and distribution systems operations. Cynthia also leads the annual Main Cleaning Program that removes sediment buildup in pipes.\u00a0 With a strong interest in engineering and science, Cynthia continued her graduate education at UCLA receiving a Master's in Civil and Environmental Engineering. In addition, she continued Environmental Science and Engineering research at UCLA through a professional doctorate program. Growing up in the City of Macau, close to Hong Kong, she saw first-hand how difficult water treatment was due to source water quality and seawater intrusion. \u00a0Recognizing these challenges, Cynthia was inspired to help others by learning about water treatment technologies to provide safe and tasty drinking water. \u00a0 \u00a0 As a Fremont resident, Cynthia enjoys being able to help and serve her community by providing clean and safe drinking water. She works on water quality studies and supports treatment processes that provides water to her home located in the service area as the Treatment Plant #2 Process Engineer! \u00a0 \"Growing up in the City of Macau, close to Hong Kong, I saw first-hand how difficult water treatment was due to source water quality and seawater intrusion. Recognizing these challenges, it inspired me to help others by learning about water treatment technologies to provide safe and tasty drinking water.\"\u00a0 *as of 4/22 Renee, Buyer in Procurement and Contracts Whether the need is for nuts and bolts or grazing goats, Renee, a Buyer in Procurement and Contracts, prepares and processes purchasing requests with the same detailed research and attention. When she\u2019s not at work her focus is on the soccer field as a coach, player and fan - let\u2019s go Manchester United! Find out how she got her star t at ACWD and more. \u00a0 Renee started working at ACWD 15 years ago as a District Services Aide. After a few years, she was promoted to several other positions within the Procurement & Contracts division before becoming a Buyer. Prior to her current appointment, she worked alongside a Buyer, Tracey, who knew everything there was to know about ACWD. \u00a0She was her mentor and the type of employee she immediately knew she wanted to be.\u00a0 Renee's favorite part about working at ACWD is her coworkers. She explains, we have built a family at ACWD, and we treat each other as such. We laugh together and, at times, have cried together as well, but we all take pride in what we do to serve our community. In Renee's free, time she is a huge soccer fan. All\u00a0three\u00a0of her children play soccer, and when she's not on the sideline supporting them, she tries\u00a0to\u00a0squeeze in a game for herself. She\u00a0also\u00a0coaches her youngest\u2019s soccer team and she is on our local soccer club's Board of Directors.\u00a0You\u00a0can find Renee at a soccer field somewhere when she's not working. Throughout Renee's career as a buyer for ACWD, she has purchased plenty of unusual items, but goats take the cake. Beleive it or not, we procure goats to graze hillsides for weed abatement. The next time you see goats up on the hills, know that they are not only up there filling their tummies but doing a service by eliminating overgrowth to help reduce fire hazards.\u00a0 \"We have built a family at ACWD, and we treat each other as such.

His photographs are in many District outreach materials, including this issue\u2019s cover photo!\u00a0 At ACWD, Carlos helps to design improvements to our system and oversee their construction. Currently he is working on a renovation of a booster station to improve water pressure. It is an intricate task to fit a thousand components into a small concrete box while keeping it accessible for maintenance.\u00a0 After the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake Carlos really began thinking his future career. He was seven at the time, and \u00a0memories of that event piqued his interest in structural engineering.\u00a0 Years later, as a Fremont resident during the 2015 drought, the District\u2019s customer communications caught his attention. It was a chance to be part of something important, and in 2018 he\u00a0joined the ACWD team. In his spare time, Carlos enjoys visiting local parks with his son and showing him the wildlife \u2013 Carlos explains that nature is all around us, even in the middle of town. A fun fact, my wife and I were married at Quarry Lakes, and now I am part of the agency responsible for its water management -it is such a beautiful place.\u00a0 He also enjoys building and painting scale models and miniatures.\u00a0 \"A fun fact, my wife and I were married at Quarry Lakes, and now I am part of the agency responsible for its water management -it is such a beautiful place!\" *As of 8/20 Patty, Customer Service Representative She\u2019s \u201ckind of a big deal\u201d here at ACWD. Customers come in to pay their bill just to see and talk to her; she\u2019s a ray of sunshine and loves interacting with the public. Meet Patty, Customer Service extraordinaire.\u00a0 In 2006 Patty was coaching a Fremont baseball team and was approached by a parent who had seen an opening for a Customer Service Rep at ACWD and they thought she would be perfect for the job. And 13 years later they were spot on. Patty admits that she loves ACWD customers and nothing makes her \u00a0happier then to work on an issue with them and resolve it together. She says, it\u2019s the best feeling to put a smile on a customer\u2019s face! During the COVID-19 pandemic Patty expressed how grateful she was to be able to work and provide service to ACWD customers. Although she admits that it\u2019s definitely not the same; she really missed the face to face communication with everyone. Like she always says \u201cI\u2019m always working on my social skills!\u201d Outside of work you can find Patty at a bowling alley near you! She bowls three times a week at Cloverleaf Bowl in Fremont and her daughter bowls in tournaments all over Northern California. She loves spending time with her family and occasionally you might find her on a buffalo slot machine! \"It\u2019s the best feeling to put a smile on a customer\u2019s face!\" *As of 5/20 Voltaire, Facility Maintenance Electrician With 11 years under his belt here at ACWD, Voltaire is considered one of the best at what he does, a Facility Maintenance Electrician. He started in the Army Reserves where he was trained on electrical, refrigeration and equipment repair. After 6 years in the reserves Voltaire knew his passion was in the electrical field and wanted\u00a0to pursue it. Voltaire explains that as an Electrician you are constantly being challenged with different projects and problems and I really enjoy that part of the job. Here at ACWD, his work group consists of skilled individuals and that often collaborate on issues and come up with solutions together that are best for the District and Voltaire finds that to be very rewarding. At ACWD, Electricians install and maintain electrical equipment, power generation and emergency backup system used in water production, treatment, distribution and office facilities. They also install and maintain communication systems throughout the District as well as video surveillance, access control, life and safety systems. They\u00a0are constantly on the move! Voltaire has worked on many projects, but the Capital Improvement Project where his group replaced all of the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) at our Water Treatment Plant #2 in Fremont is by far his favorite. PLCs and related software provide behind-the-scenes control of many of our water systems\u2019 operations, you can think of them as the brains of our facilities. The electrical team had to identify thousands of wires and devices and then produce a drawing to use to build and install new panels. Once complete they had to test every valve and part to ensure it was functioning properly. The electrical team worked with a great team of ACWD engineers, instrument technicians and outside contractors to make this project a success. When he\u2019s not working, Voltaire enjoys spending time with his wife and three children. From going to sporting events to watching them perform, they are always on the go! In the future Voltaire hopes to travel more and spend more time doing photography. \"As an Electrician you are constantly being challenged with different projects and problems and I really enjoy that part of the job\" *As of 1/20 Selina, Human Resource Analyst She defines the term \u201cservice with a smile\u201d and provides excellent internal and external customer service. Meet Selina, Human Resource Analyst who has been with the District for six years and is well-known for her upbeat attitude, outgoing personality and overall zest for life. From the moment a n applicant clicks submit on their employment application, to greeting them at their interview, and finally onboarding them as a new employee, Selina has her hands in it all. Early in her career, she was a receptionist for a school district and worked in the front lobby. Selina loved it! There was constant interaction with the public; she was always helping and guiding people and the Department Director took notice. He approached her one day and said you belong upstairs in HR. You are great with people and so outgoing, you would be a perfect fit. And the rest is history, Selina moved to the HR Department and he was right, it is exactly where she belongs. Selina admits I can\u2019t imagine working in any other field because I love meeting new people and all the daily interactions, it motivates me. It gives her job satisfaction knowing that she is a resource to internal and external customers, and they rely on her services. Selina starts the hiring process with managers who are looking for an exceptional new employee and tries to find them the best fit. She enjoys watching the process evolve and when it works out for both the candidate and the manager it makes it all worth it. Selina adds, during the hiring process, I see these candidates and I get to know them a bit. Sometimes they apply several times, so to see them get hired and succeed makes me so happy. Selina has a special love for music, dancing and going to concerts. This past year, she make a pact with a friend to attend a different concert each month for a year. She recently saw Janet Jackson and Lionel Richie! Both were amazing shows! Selina\u2019s grandbabies are also a big part of her life! She has three grandsons that she adores and loves going to the Oakland zoo and playing baseball with. Some inside advice from Selina to future candidates is to get a good night\u2019s sleep the night before, arrive early the day of your interview to mentally prepare and be sure to explain in detail why you are the right person for the job!\u00a0 \"I can\u2019t imagine working in any other field because I love meeting new people and all the daily interactions, it motivates me.\"\u00a0 *As of 10/19 Jose, Engineering Technician Since grade school, Jose has envisioned a career working with and helping people in his community \u2013a career offering a variety of work in varying environments \u2013 sometimes in an office and other times outside. So when the opportunity arose for Jose to join ACWD\u2019s Engineering Division as an \u00a0Engineering Technician, he knew it was the perfect fit! Fifteen years later, Jose is known at ACWD for his exceptional customer service and extensive on-the-job knowledge. Jose works with customers who want to upgrade existing water service, or install new service to their homes or businesses. He review plans, ensures the installation location is correct, and provides customers with a construction cost estimate. He also works on larger-scale projects, like the new Warm Springs BART Station, Pacific Commons Shopping Center and his personal favorite - the Aqua Adventure Water Park in Fremont.\u00a0 Jose admits that working with the Tri-City residents is the best part of my job! \u00a0When reviewing plans with a customer, he sits down with them and treats them like family. He is always very honest and tries to provide the most cost effective options for their project. Jose gets it\u2013 home remodeling can be stressful, and the last thing he wants to do is add to the stress. His goal is to be informative so the customer can make knowledgeable decisions. \u00a0 Jose loves to travel, explore and visit new places with his wife and daughters. They love to be active; this fall they look forward to joining the East Bay Regional Parks \u201cTrails Challenge\u201d to check out all of the local trails in the area. It\u2019s a great way to spend quality time and get outdoors! \"Working with the Tri-City residents is the best part of my job!\" *As of 05/2019 Mike, Auto Mechanic You may not see him often, but you will see his work driving around daily. That is because Mike is one of two ACWD highly skilled auto mechanics. With more than 35 years of auto mechanic experience, Mike specializes as a heavy equipment diesel mechanic.\u00a0 Mike has always enjoyed working on heavy equipment - tractors, trains, and off-road heavy equipment. Fixing things and problem solving is second nature. The work he does is behind the scenes, ensuring District vehicles are safe and equipment is reliable so field crews can do their jobs. In doing so, Mike earns their confidence, and that\u2019s important to him. Mike began his District career five years ago, and although he has extensive experience as a mechanic, the water industry was new to him. Now, he sees that even from the mechanic shop, the work he does plays a part in providing an essential service to the community of which he both works and lives in. Mike states that water is vital to life and knowing that his job helps to contribute to the service provided to the Tri-Cities is rewarding. Mike enjoys travelling with his wife and two dogs, Roxy, and Gunnar. They are explorers and love the outdoors, spending time in their camper and riding their utility terrain vehicles (UTVs) - the Mohave Desert is one of their favorite places! Mike says that Roxy is fearless, and rides along on the UTV - she loves to bark at the wind. Something most people may not know about Mike is that he cooks and gardens! Mike states that there is nothing like fresh vegetables grown in your backyard. For him, it\u2019s corn, tomatoes, squash, and cucumbers. Fresh being the best! Mike adds his homegrown tomatoes to tacos, one of his favorite foods to make. When the weekends are spent at home, you can find him smoking ribs and tri-tip, relaxing in the yard, and enjoying the comfortable Bay Area weather. A fun fact about Mike is that in May 2017, he received special recognition from the ACWD Board of Directors for a suggestion he made relating to the operations of the mechanic shop. It was a cost-saving measure and a benefit to the District. Go Mike! \"Water is vital to life and knowing that my job helps to contribute to the service provided to the Tri-Cities is rewarding.\"\u00a0 *As of 10/2018 Sharene, Senior Public Affairs Specialist As the Senior Public Affairs Specialist, Sharene helps to implement District communications and community engagement goals. She says she is fortunate enough to have the opportunity to work on a variety of projects and collaborate with all departments throughout the District. Sharene takes pride in her work knowing that water is such a n essential part of life and that she gets to share information about its importance. One of her most challenging, yet rewarding projects to date was to coordinate a volunteer effort to paint water conservation murals on District facilities along Alameda Creek. This project had detailed components and the timeline was very short, which is often the case in public affairs, but the outcome was great! ACWD staff and volunteers worked together and to this day, the murals remain an artistic way to remind us to all conserve water. Sharene\u2019s most rewarding aspect of her job is knowing that the work she does raises awareness about water, and with that, knowing that we can each have a positive impact on our environment. When she is talking with customers and children during events or tours, she gets to share in that \"ah-ha\" moment when folks learn the ripple effects of conservation, that some of their water comes from Alameda Creek watershed, or that ACWD operates a desalination facility in Newark. Recently, Sharene worked with over 200 First LEGO League Challenge participants, giving them tours of our treatment facility and discussing our treatment processes. She loves when she can be creative and take technical and complex topics like treatment and make it fun and relatable. When she sees the excitement in kids\u2019 eyes and know she sparked interest in their young minds or piqued curiosity that may evoke change - that is the real reward. In her free time, Sharene enjoys being active - hiking, practicing yoga, and taking spontaneous day trips. Sharene teaches Hot Pilates and enjoys leading her students through their wellness journey. And yet, she is also happy to relax at home, cook, and binge watch true-crime investigation shows. And what is her favorite fact about water you ask? That we drink the same water dinosaurs drink! The water cycle is an amazing thing and through its process allows water to recycle. \"When I see the excitement in kids\u2019 eyes and know that I sparked interest in their young minds or piqued curiosity that may evoke change - that is the real reward.\" *As of 08/2018 Ryan, Laboratory Technician With a curious mind and an interest in chemistry, Ryan collects samples throughout the water distribution system to ensure it remains safe to drink. Ryan says that the beauty of his job is the variation of tasks - there is field work, desk work, and la b work so he gets to mix it up, which he says he likes. When Ryan is in the field, he and the other technicians visit 53 sample points weekly. They take small collections of finished water, water that has already been treated, so that it can be tested at our state-certified lab. Ryan describes his co-workers as an extension of his family and he enjoys working with them all. Lab work requires teamwork and he is proud to be part of a great team - co-workers he considers to be friends. They each lend support to complete whatever the task is at hand, and everyone steps up to the plate regardless. Ryan says that enjoying the people you work with makes a huge difference and he says that the friendships he\u2019s made over the last four years at ACWD are the most rewarding part of his job - that it makes it easy to come to work. Due to his job, Ryan often talks with customers when he is near sampling stations. He loves that customers have questions and are truly interested in the work he does - such as, is the water safe to drink? How do you test the water? The list goes on. One day, he had a customer and his two young daughters approach him and the girls asked if he could show them \"the magic trick that makes the water change color\". What they wanted to see was how the water changes to pink during a chlorine test which indicates sufficient chlorine as been added to treat the water. Although Ryan knows the science behind the test, he says he did feel like a magician when the girls\u2019 face lit up with excitement as the beaker shifted from clear to pink. He states that their reaction was the magic. What does Ryan do outside of work? Well, Ryan feels life is best enjoyed through experiences and exploration. For him, that is travelling. He enjoys visiting new countries, experiencing the food, culture, people, and outdoor activities. His favorite vacation destination to date has been Thailand - he loved it. As a Bay Area native, Ryan likes to escape to warm climates that are best suited for the activities he enjoys most - hiking, snorkeling, and riding ATV\u2019s. Ryan\u2019s future plans include visiting Vietnam, Japan, and the Philippines. But, he says all of that in due time; he\u2019s saving up - it\u2019s all a balance. When it comes to his curious side, Ryan says his super power of choice would be teleportation because he could get anywhere in 10 seconds. With that, it sounds like Ryan could start checking off his vacation destinations. \"Their reaction was the magic.\" *As of 08/2018 David, Utility Worker III If a customer calls our emergency hotline to report a leak, a water pressure  issue, or other emergency, chances are David will be the first responder. With more than 20 years on the job, David, a Utility Worker III and Newark native is committed to providing excellent customer service with prompt assessments of emergencies and other \u00a0customer needs. Whether it\u2019s as simple as replacing a broken water meter lid, or as critical as a full-scale main rupture, David is prepared to control the incident through his years of experience and training received in the Incident Command System (ICS). His vital role as the first on scene incident commander, assure customers will get their water back in service in a timely manner. On any given day, David may respond to as many as 20 calls. A customer\u2019s water service may be interrupted, and quickly identifying the cause for water loss is important. Their response time is typically less than one hour, with more rapid response for critical safety and property damage emergencies. Quick action not only gets the customers back in service but reduces water waste that may be caused by leaks or a broken water line. Because safety is a priority, David\u2019s role in contacting Underground Service Alert (USA) to identify other underground utilities is particularly important. \"When making water main repairs, we want to ensure gas, electric, and sewer, communication lines, are properly marked to beginning repair work to ensure safety of those on scene.\" \u00a0In working with potable water distribution lines, it\u2019s critical to follow proper regulatory protocol. David possesses a State Water Resources Control Board Distribution II certification; this demonstrates his knowledge, skills, and ability to meet regulatory standards. He is also certified to operate a backhoe. In fact, David notes, \"Through my 20 years\u2019 experience, I have become very proficient.\" \u00a0Having had a lengthy career with the District, David\u2019s biggest professional accomplishment was back in 2006, ACWD had sent him and five others to provide mutual aid in recovery efforts following Hurricane Katrina, \"witnessing firsthand devastation and disaster was humbling and something I\u2019ll never forget.\" They worked from sunrise to sunset for 12 straight days to help restore water service. \"We lost count of how many repairs were made, but knowing I was able to help during that crisis- that is my biggest professional accomplishment.\" *As of 04/2017 Jason, Water Controller I \u00a0M eet Jason, he\u2019s been with ACWD since July 6, 1998! During his time here, he\u2019s had the opportunity to hold three different positions, which have given him the chance to learn, grow, and be promoted within the agency. As a water controller, he is involved in a host of activities along Alameda Creek and our watershed.\u00a0What Jason find most rewarding, but challenging, is predicting rainfall amounts and projected flow rates that help us make decisions on how to effectively capture as much water as is needed. In addition to these responsibilities, Jason may interact with 10-15 members of the public, with that, he keeps his customer service philosophy simple: \"treat others as I like to be treated\". Because he interacts regularly with customers, it gives him an opportunity to explain ACWD\u2019s operations to the public so you can understand how we optimize water flows, while meeting regulations. One of his most interesting experiences on the job occurred along Alameda Creek, when he saw a bald eagle cruising above the creek bed near Niles. Having lived around Fremont for more than 35 years, Jason never expected to see a bald eagle. He states, \"That was a great day at work\"! \"Water is such an important resource and being able to be a part of providing it to our customers is an honor.\"\u00a0 *As of 04/2017 David, Customer Account Field Representative Sometimes while working with ACWD, we may have employees that don\u2019t just have one\u00a0 duty; instead they may perform a\u00a0 multitude of tasks. These skills are highly valuable because it allows our staff to be extremely flexible and able to assist each other in d ifferent areas. With 15 years of service and countless hours walked to provide meter reading and customer service, we are pleased to introduce David, our Customer Account Field Representative. David wears several hats in his role, these include: meter reading, collections, turning service on and off, in-office customer service support, and he also serves on the Safety Committee. Before starting his career with ACWD, David worked in retail management and the technology industry. But when the tech industry took a turn, he decided with his background in customer service and interest in giving back to the community, that he truly wanted a career in public service. What David finds most rewarding in helping customers is since he is in the field all day; he may be the only interaction our customers have with the District. He\u2019s had several instances when reading a meter and customers come out to talk with him. David uses that opportunity to show them how to read their meter as well as check for leaks. David states that there was one particularly challenging day where, \"I was on a route and got caught in a rain and lightning storm and all I could think about was, \u2019I\u2019m in a lightning storm walking around with a metal stick.\u2019 The stick is a meter reading stick used to manipulate meter lids.\" He brings this story up to point out that people have the misconception that his job entails only walking to read meters. That said, he\u2019s out in 100 degree temperatures or when it\u2019s cold and rainy. Add to that, the hazards of dog bites, vehicle traffic, and the physical demands of walking 8 miles a day year after year- it\u2019s a lot more than just walking. But David takes pride in what he does knowing our customers deserve the best possible service. \"Each duty has its benefits and challenges but I enjoy my work most when I\u2019m able to help customers.\" *As of 04/2017 Sylvia, Treatment Facility Operator In our mission to provide clean, safe, and reliable drinking water at a reasonable\u00a0 price, we are pleased to introduce our employees  who work to ensure this happens. Meet Sylvia, a treatment facility operator who\u00a0uses her training, knowledge, and experience to safeguard your drinking water supply.\u00a0 \u00a0 Sylvia\u2019s career in water operations began in 2005 while working for another municipality. She began learning about water main installations, and as her fascination grew, she wanted to grow with and contribute to an organization. Sylvia joined ACWD in 2008 and hasn\u2019t looked back. Over the years, she has obtained, and currently possesses, three State of California certifications, including: American Water Works Association Water Quality Analyst Grade 2; Water Distribution Operator Grade 3; and a Water Treatment Operator Grade 3. In order for Sylvia to prepare to operate a water treatment facility, certifications and ongoing training is key. Water treatment operators are responsible for public health and safety, and providing water that meets or exceeds state and federal regulations is a priority. She states, \"It is equally important to have both a high level of skill and the knowledge necessary to take charge of operating a water treatment facility.\" They are trained to act quickly and to be responsive in the event of unplanned situations which are key in delivering an uninterrupted water supply. As a treatment facility operator, Sylvia and the other operator\u2019s decisions directly impact the quality and quantity of the drinking water delivered to our customers. Speaking of community, Sylvia notes, \"ACWD demonstrates community involvement in many ways; one is by sponsoring an employee a year to participate in the Fremont Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Leadership Fremont Program.\" Sylvia happily represented ACWD in 2015 and says, \"I gained personal and professional growth through my participation.\" Most recently, she participated in the Tri-City Health Center\u2019s Superhero Run. \"I\u2019m proud to be part of an organization that delivers such an important and necessary resource to the community.\" *As of 04/2017 Monica, Customer Account Representative\u00a0 At ACWD, we work to provide excellent customer service and are here to answer questions you may have. Monica, a customer account representative, interfaces with hundreds of customers each week and is dedicated to delivering superior service when it matters most. Although the tasks Monica completes each day are typical, no two days are the same. When working with customers, she is addressing a range of questions, inquiries, or concerns - this may be done in person, online, or over the phone. One customer may call to begin or cancel service while another may want to learn more about drought restrictions or conservation incentives and rebates. She always enjoys sharing conservation tips and informing customers about the resources available to help reduce water use or lower their bill. When Monica is not interfacing one-on-one with customers, she works to resolve billing issues, \"I enjoy research and problem solving to provide a resolution.\" Being in customer service requires vast knowledge of a variety of topics - billing and conservation to name a few. Monica came into this position with a Bachelor of Science degree and has over 25 years of experience working in the private and public sector. She has been with ACWD since 2009, during which time; her topics of interest have evolved. In order to be successful at her job, Monica keeps up to date with rates and billing information, customer consumption, conservation, and the District\u2019s mandatory water use restrictions. Monica notes, \"It\u2019s important to stay abreast of these topics to best help our customers.\" Since customer service professionals are in high demand, Monica chose ACWD when a family friend, who had retired from the District, told her about a job opportunity. Having spent the majority of her career working in customer service, she was, \"excited to join an agency with a stellar reputation.\" \"I enjoy working with people on a one-on-one basis and find it rewarding to help customers.\" *As of 04/2017 Ranga, Groundwater Resources Engineer With nearly 40 percent of our water supply coming from local groundwater, the\u00a0 monitoring and protection of our underground reservoir is essential. Ranga, groundwater resources engineer, is part of a team that helps protect and manage this critically important local resource. Ranga joined the District in 2003 because it allows him to make an effective contribution to groundw ater protection at the local level. As a resident of Fremont, he uses his skills and advanced degree in civil and environmental engineering to do work that directly impact his community. His professional certifications include: registered professional engineer; water distribution and water treatment operator certifications.

Home Services Groundwater Resources Sustainable Groundwater Management Act                         Sustainable Groundwater Management Act\t\t               Sustainable Groundwater Management Act On September 16, 2014, the Governor signed a three-bill package known as the  Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA)  into law that establishes a new structure for groundwater management, recognizing that groundwater management in California is best accomplished locally. For over 100 years, the Alameda County Water District (ACWD) has managed the groundwater of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin (Niles Cone Subbasin 2-09.01) through comprehensive programs that protect and improve water supplies for all groundwater users. ACWD is identified within SGMA as an agency created by statute to manage groundwater and deemed to be the exclusive local agency within its statutory boundaries to comply with SGMA (California Water Code Section 10723 et seq.). Alternative to a Groundwater Sustainability Plan As an exclusive local agency responsible for groundwater management and a Groundwater Sustainability Agency (GSA), ACWD submitted an Alternative to a Groundwater Sustainability Plan (Alternative) for the management of the Niles Cone Subbasin 2-09.01 under SGMA in 2016. ACWD\u2019s Alternative preserves and continues the successful sustainable groundwater management already being performed by ACWD. This is accomplished by continuing groundwater management under pre-existing authority by which ACWD carries out groundwater management efforts within Niles Cone, in addition to the authorities of a GSA under SGMA. \u00a0The existing planning and operating policies and documents under which ACWD currently manages the Niles Cone, and the existing information that demonstrates that ACWD has operated the Niles Cone within its sustainable yield for at least 10 years, satisfies the requirements of an Alternative. \u00a0These existing documents and information show that ACWD has managed the Niles Cone sustainably for decades, meeting the objective of SGMA. On July 17, 2019, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) approved ACWD\u2019s Alternative for the Niles Cone. DWR\u2019s approval was accompanied by a  Statement of Findings Regarding the Approval of the Niles Cone Subbasin Alternative  which included seven recommended actions for ACWD to incorporate in the five\u2011year update to the Alternative (Alternative Update), which was due on January 1, 2022. Per SGMA requirements, the Alternative Update will describe whether the Alternative is meeting sustainability goals and recommended actions. ACWD's  Alternative Update  was submitted to DWR on December 29, 2021. \u00a0As a result, a 75-day public comment period is now open from January 6, 2022, through March 22, 2022. \u00a0DWR is asking that all public comments on the Alternative Update be provided to DWR through their SGMA Portal. \u00a0The Alternative Update is not a plan amendment but is a 5-year written assessment that describes and provides an update on ACWD's groundwater management efforts, an explanation of how the Alternative Update is functionally equivalent to elements of a Groundwater Sustainability Plan, incorporates DWR's seven recommended actions, and includes information on proposed projects, management actions, and/or next steps to ensure the continued sustainable management of the Niles Cone. ACWD\u2019s Alternative,  Alternative Update , and Alternative  Annual Reports  can be found on DWR's SGMA Portal. Basin Boundary Modification DWR adopted emergency regulations regarding the process for seeking groundwater basin boundary modifications under SGMA. In Bulletin-118 Update 2003, the graphical representation included in Bulletin 118 (2003) did not match the written description of the northern boundary as it did not extend all the way to the northern boundary of ACWD including the areas located within the City of Hayward that were detached and that ACWD expressly retained groundwater management authority over. Since the basin boundaries in Bulletin 118 will now play a critical role in the management of California\u2019s groundwater basins, ACWD submitted a Basin Boundary Modification Request to correct the Niles Cone Groundwater Bas i n. On July 1, 2016, ACWD received notice from DWR that the Basin Boundary Modification Request had been approved, as modified by DWR. \u00a0 Groundwater Sustainability Agency Formation On November 10, 2016, ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors adopted  Resolution No. 16-069  deciding to become the GSA for the Niles Cone Subbasin 2-09.01. ACWD\u2019s becoming the GSA for the Niles Cone Subbasin continues existing groundwater management under SGMA, in addition to other recognized regulatory authority. SGMA provides various authorities to GSAs to promote sustainable groundwater management including the ability to meter wells and fund and implement groundwater management projects. While many of these authorities have been available to ACWD for many years under the Replenishment Assessment Act of the Alameda County Water District, SGMA provides additional authority that may further the ability of ACWD to sustainably manage the Niles Cone.

Further, on February 13, 2023, Governor Newsom issued  Executive Order N-3-23 , which provides an update on water use and supply conditions in California.\u00a0 Please call Kit Soo at 510-668-4455, Well Ordinance Supervisor, for more information regarding how the new water well permitting requirements may impact ACWD\u2019s permit application process. As required by ACWD Ordinance No. 2010-01, drilling permits are required prior to the start of any subsurface drilling activities for wells, exploratory holes, and other excavations. ACWD also requires a permit for inactive classification for any well or other excavation which will not be used for a period of 12 months, but which the owner intends to use in the future.  Please read the permit instructions to ensure submittal of a complete permit application package. All permitted work requires  scheduling for inspection ; therefore, all drilling activities must be coordinated with ACWD prior to the start of any field work.

Home Services Groundwater Resources Groundwater Protection Environmental Screening Levels                         Environmental Screening Levels\t\t               Description The document, \"User's Guide: Derivation and Application of Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs)\", - Interim Final 2016 (February 2016) is a technical report prepared by staff of the California Regional Water Quality Board, San Francisco Bay Region. Information provided in the document is not intended to establish policy or regulation. The document presents Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for chemicals commonly found in soil and groundwater at sites where releases of hazardous chemicals have occurred. The ESLs are presented in a series of tables. Each table reflects a specific combination of soil, groundwater and land-use characteristics that strongly influence the magnitude of environmental concerns at a given site. This allows the user to select ESLs that are most applicable to a given site. The Tier 1 ESLs presented in the lookup tables are NOT regulatory cleanup standards. The presence of a chemical at concentrations in excess of an ESL does not necessarily indicate that adverse impacts to human health or the environment are occurring; this simply indicates that a potential for adverse risk may exist and that additional evaluation is warranted.

Home Services Groundwater Resources Groundwater Protection Cooperative Agreements                         Cooperative Agreements\t\t               Objective ACWD entered into Cooperative Agreements with the Regional Water Quality Control Board and the cities of Fremont, Newark, Union City and Hayward to further strengthen the interagency coordination and cost-effective implementation of groundwater protection within the cities. The Regional Water Quality Control Board (PDF)  - Since 1988, ACWD informally provided assistance to the California Regional Water Quality Control Board - San Francisco Bay Region (Regional Board) in overseeing the investigation and remediation at leaking underground fuel tank (LUFT) and spills, leaks, investigation and cleanup (SLIC) sites. In order to memorialize the terms of this participation and to further strengthen the coordination between the Regional Board and ACWD, the agencies entered into a Cooperative Agreement on  June 27, 1996 . City of Fremont (PDF)  -  March 25, 1997 City of Newark (PDF)  -  June 26, 1997 -\u00a0  On October 8, 2009, the Cooperative Agreement with the City of Newark was updated to include the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health because of the transfer of the Certified Unified Program Agency responsibility from the City of Newark to the Alameda County Department of Environmental Health. City of Union City (PDF)  -  August 12, 1997\u00a0 City of Hayward (PDF)  - ACWD also entered into an agreement with the City of Hayward on  July 27, 2000  to work cooperatively on sites which threaten or affect water quality in the portions of the City of Hayward that are within the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin (Hayward Detachment areas).

Field work occurs during the spring and fall of each year in order to provide insight into subsurface conditions when water levels tend to be at their highest and lowest. The program records the status of wells owned by public agencies and private owners, and includes the collection of groundwater samples and the measurement of groundwater levels throughout the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. A Groundwater Monitoring Report is prepared annually to document the results of the field data collection. Download a copy of the most recent  Groundwater Monitoring Report (PDF) .  California Statewide Groundwater Elevation Monitoring (CASGEM) Program The CASGEM Program was established in response to State Legislation which mandates a statewide monitoring program to track seasonal and long-term groundwater elevation trends in California's groundwater basins. In 2012, ACWD was designated by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) as a Monitoring Entity for the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. As a Monitoring Entity, ACWD developed a monitoring plan and regularly submits groundwater level measurements to the DWR's online database in an effort to improve the management of California's groundwater resources.

Northwest Region -\u00a0 The first grant, for fiscal year 2003-2004, was awarded by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) in the amount of $249,900 to install eight monitoring wells in four locations south of Highway 92 in the northwest region of the Niles Cone groundwater Basin. This project has been completed and a final report was issued on April 12, 2006. View the  northwest region grant information (PDF) . Southwest Region -\u00a0 The second grant, for fiscal year 2004-2005, was awarded by DWR in the amount of $249,943 to install eight monitoring wells in two locations within the Don Edwards Wildlife Refuge in the southwest region of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. This project has been completed and a final report was issued on May 7, 2007. View the  southwest region grant information (PDF) . Central Region -\u00a0 The third grant, for fiscal year 2007-2008, was awarded by DWR in the amount of $250,000 to install eleven monitoring wells at seven locations in the central portion of the City of Fremont. The wells were installed to evaluate saltwater intrusion within two major drinking water aquifers, the Centerville and Fremont Aquifers, of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. This project has been completed and a final report was issued on April 28, 2010. View the  central region grant information (PDF) . Western Region -  The fourth grant, for fiscal year 2011-2012, was awarded by DWR in the amount of $225,000 to install six monitoring wells at four locations within property owned/operated by the Don Edwards National Wildlife Refuge in the western region of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. The wells were installed to evaluate the western extent of saltwater intrusion within two major drinking water aquifers, the Centerville and Fremont Aquifers. The project has been completed and a final report was issued on March 30, 2016. View the  western region grant information (PDF) . Western Region -\u00a0 The fifth grant, for fiscal year 2020-2021, was awarded by the California State Water Resources Control Board in the amount of $206,965 to destroy two abandoned legacy irrigation wells located within property owned/operated by the Don Edwards National Wildlife Refuge (in the western section of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin) that were acting as potential preferential pathways for saltwater to enter into active water production aquifers. Destruction of the wells will assist in limiting the amount of saltwater intrusion impacting drinking water sources and threatening ACWD\u2019s Mowry Wellfield. The project has been completed and a  Final Project Report (PDF)  was issued on March 30, 2022, and a  Final Project Summary (PDF)  was issued on April 7, 2022. Central Region -  The sixth grant, for fiscal year 2022-2023, was awarded by the California State Water Resources Control Board in the amount of $613,048 to conduct a remedial investigation and feasibility study (RI/FS) to identify and evaluate alternatives to prevent migration of brackish water to ACWD's drinking water supply wells. Investigations were conducted at three locations to evaluate each alternative's potential to achieve the desired benefits of a future Implementation Project to prevent saltwater migration to the Mowry Wellfield, accelerate brackish water removal from the Centerville-Fremont Aquifer, and reclaim aquifer storage. Based on the results of the RI/FS, one of the locations was selected as a feasible site to conduct the future Implementation Project. The project has been completed and a  RI/FS Report (PDF)  and  Final Project Summary (PDF)  were issued on September 28, 2022, and a  Final Project Report (PDF)  was issued on September 29, 2022.

What is the purpose of the Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Program?     The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program is part of the Alameda County Water District\u2019s (District) commitment to delivering reliable drinking water supplies to more than 356,000 people living and working in Fremont, Newark and Union City. The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program will help improve water supply reliability for ACWD customers in the event of a major earthquake and will reduce service interruptions due to aging pipelines. Generally, pipelines have a lifespan of about 75 years, but the risk of a pipeline\u2019s failure increases in proportion with its age. With twenty percent of the District\u2019s pipelines installed before 1960, and the oldest pipelines placed underground in the 1940s, this project represents a major infrastructure improvement for more than 84,000 customers who depend upon reliable water supplies. Proactive pipeline upgrades protect the District and its customers from expensive fixes caused by leaks in the system.           2.   How can I stay up to date on the construction schedule?     The District is prioritizing construction sites in order of risk and project complexity within the overall program budget. Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.           3.   Why are the construction projects spread over multiple years?     All of ACWD\u2019s construction activities must comply with specific permit requirements and must take into account weather conditions and safety precautions. The staggered nature of the construction helps the District maintain reasonable working hours and reduce inconveniences to the public associated with very early and very late construction working hours.           4.   Who is paying for these projects?     The residents and businesses of Fremont, Newark, and Union City who, as ratepayers, contribute to these projects. We want to ensure our customers are aware of how their rate dollars are being used to improve water supply reliability and protect public health and safety. The costs for these projects are being funded in two ways: \u2022 Project costs have been factored into existing rate structures. \u2022 In 2012 ACWD successfully issued $45.2 million in Water Revenue Bonds to restructure existing debt at reduced interest rates and to help finance critical capital projects. By doing so, we are able to make investments in infrastructure while leveraging the District\u2019s excellent AAA bond rating and take advantage of historic low interest rates.           5.   How are you managing construction traffic?      The District is requiring its contractors to ensure that construction traffic is managed effectively and that truck traffic follows posted speed limits. We will have inspectors evaluating the project sites to ensure that rules are enforced and will address any issues that arise.           6.   How will you ensure safety at project sites during construction?     The District will ensure its contractors take precautions to ensure safety during construction, including installing barriers along construction routes, restricting travel speeds and implementing construction safety monitoring during all work. The District will provide project oversight and review during every stage of construction to ensure safety and design requirements are met, including the avoidance of gas lines and other pipelines. In the event of an emergency, the District will implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of surrounding residents, businesses and construction crews.           7.   Will the quality of the water delivered to my home be affected?     The District is committed to monitoring and ensuring water quality standards at all times. During construction, water pipelines may need to be temporarily isolated to accommodate improvements. This action may cause reverse flows in the pipeline, causing iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the pipeline to be stirred up, resulting in discolored water. However, water will remain safe to drink and continue to meet all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety.

What is the purpose of the Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Program?     The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program is part of the Alameda County Water District\u2019s (District) commitment to delivering reliable drinking water supplies to more than 356,000 people living and working in Fremont, Newark and Union City. The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program will help improve water supply reliability for ACWD customers in the event of a major earthquake and will reduce service interruptions due to aging pipelines.

Proactive pipeline upgrades protect the District and its customers from expensive fixes caused by leaks in the system.           2.   How can I stay up to date on the construction schedule?     The District is prioritizing construction sites in order of risk and project complexity within the overall program budget. Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.           3.   Why are the construction projects spread over multiple years?     All of ACWD\u2019s construction activities must comply with specific permit requirements and must take into account weather conditions and safety precautions. The staggered nature of the construction helps the District maintain reasonable working hours and reduce inconveniences to the public associated with very early and very late construction working hours.           4.   Who is paying for these projects?     The residents and businesses of Fremont, Newark, and Union City who, as ratepayers, contribute to these projects. We want to ensure our customers are aware of how their rate dollars are being used to improve water supply reliability and protect public health and safety. The costs for these projects are being funded in two ways: \u2022 Project costs have been factored into existing rate structures. \u2022 In 2012 ACWD successfully issued $45.2 million in Water Revenue Bonds to restructure existing debt at reduced interest rates and to help finance critical capital projects. By doing so, we are able to make investments in infrastructure while leveraging the District\u2019s excellent AAA bond rating and take advantage of historic low interest rates.           5.   How are you managing construction traffic?      The District is requiring its contractors to ensure that construction traffic is managed effectively and that truck traffic follows posted speed limits. We will have inspectors evaluating the project sites to ensure that rules are enforced and will address any issues that arise.           6.   How will you ensure safety at project sites during construction?     The District will ensure its contractors take precautions to ensure safety during construction, including installing barriers along construction routes, restricting travel speeds and implementing construction safety monitoring during all work. The District will provide project oversight and review during every stage of construction to ensure safety and design requirements are met, including the avoidance of gas lines and other pipelines. In the event of an emergency, the District will implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of surrounding residents, businesses and construction crews.           7.   Will the quality of the water delivered to my home be affected?     The District is committed to monitoring and ensuring water quality standards at all times. During construction, water pipelines may need to be temporarily isolated to accommodate improvements. This action may cause reverse flows in the pipeline, causing iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the pipeline to be stirred up, resulting in discolored water. However, water will remain safe to drink and continue to meet all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears.

What is the purpose of the Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Program?     The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program is part of the Alameda County Water District\u2019s (District) commitment to delivering reliable drinking water supplies to more than 356,000 people living and working in Fremont, Newark and Union City. The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program will help improve water supply reliability for ACWD customers in the event of a major earthquake and will reduce service interruptions due to aging pipelines. Generally, pipelines have a lifespan of about 75 years, but the risk of a pipeline\u2019s failure increases in proportion with its age. With twenty percent of the District\u2019s pipelines installed before 1960, and the oldest pipelines placed underground in the 1940s, this project represents a major infrastructure improvement for more than 84,000 customers who depend upon reliable water supplies. Proactive pipeline upgrades protect the District and its customers from expensive fixes caused by leaks in the system.           2.   How can I stay up to date on the construction schedule?     The District is prioritizing construction sites in order of risk and project complexity within the overall program budget. Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.           3.   Why are the construction projects spread over multiple years?     All of ACWD\u2019s construction activities must comply with specific permit requirements and must take into account weather conditions and safety precautions. The staggered nature of the construction helps the District maintain reasonable working hours and reduce inconveniences to the public associated with very early and very late construction working hours.           4.   Who is paying for these projects?     The residents and businesses of Fremont, Newark, and Union City who, as ratepayers, contribute to these projects. We want to ensure our customers are aware of how their rate dollars are being used to improve water supply reliability and protect public health and safety. The costs for these projects are being funded in two ways: \u2022 Project costs have been factored into existing rate structures. \u2022 In 2012 ACWD successfully issued $45.2 million in Water Revenue Bonds to restructure existing debt at reduced interest rates and to help finance critical capital projects. By doing so, we are able to make investments in infrastructure while leveraging the District\u2019s excellent AAA bond rating and take advantage of historic low interest rates.           5.   How are you managing construction traffic?      The District is requiring its contractors to ensure that construction traffic is managed effectively and that truck traffic follows posted speed limits. We will have inspectors evaluating the project sites to ensure that rules are enforced and will address any issues that arise.           6.   How will you ensure safety at project sites during construction?     The District will ensure its contractors take precautions to ensure safety during construction, including installing barriers along construction routes, restricting travel speeds and implementing construction safety monitoring during all work. The District will provide project oversight and review during every stage of construction to ensure safety and design requirements are met, including the avoidance of gas lines and other pipelines. In the event of an emergency, the District will implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of surrounding residents, businesses and construction crews.           7.   Will the quality of the water delivered to my home be affected?     The District is committed to monitoring and ensuring water quality standards at all times. During construction, water pipelines may need to be temporarily isolated to accommodate improvements. This action may cause reverse flows in the pipeline, causing iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the pipeline to be stirred up, resulting in discolored water. However, water will remain safe to drink and continue to meet all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears. Please visit ACWD\u2019s website at www.acwd.org to learn how to flush the pipes in your home to remove the discoloration.

What is the purpose of the projects along Alameda Creek?     The projects along Alameda Creek will allow steelhead trout and other threatened/endangered fish species to more easily and safely migrate upstream and downstream. At the same time, they will allow us to maintain reliable water supplies for residents and businesses in Fremont, Newark, and Union City.           2.   Why is ACWD concerned about fish in Alameda Creek?     Steelhead trout are a federally listed threatened species. Modifications to the Alameda Creek streambed and urbanization of the surrounding region have eliminated spawning areas and made it impossible for steelhead to migrate upstream. As a result, steelhead trout have been absent from Alameda Creek and its tributaries for several decades. Without implementing these projects, we would have to significantly curtail our groundwater recharge operations, limiting our ability to maintain reliable water supplies from Alameda Creek. \t\t\t         3.   How will these projects improve fish passage?     Threatened steelhead trout utilize Alameda Creek to migrate to/from the ocean on a journey that is an important part of our ecosystem. ACWD is working to enhance the migration conditions for steelhead trout by installing state-of-the-art fish screens and ladders.\t\t\t         4.   Who is involved?     ACWD is part of a regional effort focused on protecting the needs of threatened/endangered fish. Other partners include the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, Zone 7 Water Agency, East Bay Regional Park District, and Alameda County Public Works Agency, ACWD\u2019s efforts to improve steelhead passage through Alameda Creek represent a critical link in the greater Bay Area and northern California restoration efforts.\t\t\t         5.   When and where will construction take place?    ACWD\u2019s ongoing commitment to environmental and wildlife protection includes the construction of several projects along Alameda Creek. These projects span several years --- several projects have been completed with projects continuing into 2021. Up-to-date project locations and schedules can be found at: www.acwd.org/Fishway.   We will strive to limit construction hours to Monday-Friday between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., but construction may also occur on Saturdays and Sundays or at night, as needed. We will post notices where construction will occur and provide advance notice of construction activities so that you can more easily plan your commute and trail use.            6.   What construction impacts can be expected?     Nearby residents, businesses, and commuters may experience typical construction impacts, such as noise, dust, heavy equipment, and visual impacts during construction hours. In addition, areas around construction sites may have limited access for periods of time in order to ensure safety and permitting compliance. Temporary traffic impacts may also be experienced as construction crews navigate equipment and manage construction routes. \t\t\t         7.   How will construction traffic be managed?     As equipment is moved in and out of construction sites, temporary slow traffic zones and monitored traffic safety measures will be implemented. Because safety is a top priority for ACWD, it may be necessary to temporarily close portions of the street to allow for access to/from project sites. We are committed to minimizing disruptions to residents and businesses and will post information online in advance of construction activities. \t\t\t         8.   Will the Alameda Creek Trail be closed during construction?      Alameda Creek Trail provides recreation to so many in the community and we will work to limit trail closures, when possible. The safety of trail users and their pets is a priority so there may be instances when closures occur as a safety precaution.  Trail closures are not planned during the RD3 Fishway project; however; certain areas along and adjacent to the Alameda Creek Trail, such as access from Rancho Arroyo Park to the creek, may be  temporarily impacted by construction projects occurring in 2019 \u2013 2021.   Construction notices will be posted online and along recreational trails and areas to advise you of impending closures and alternative routes.  All project schedules are available at www.acwd.org/Fishway           9.   Will dogs still be allowed in Shinn Meadow?     Recreational activities at Shinn Meadow may be impacted by the construction of projects scheduled in 2019 - 2021.  A temporary gated fence to provide for an enclosed off-leash dog area will be placed around Shinn Meadow, although the area may temporarily be closed for safety. We will utilize various media to advise you of current and upcoming construction activities.            10.   Will fishing be impacted at Quarry Lakes or Shinn Pond?     The fishing pier at Quarry Lakes will be temporarily closed only during the construction of projects scheduled in 2019 - 2021 to accommodate low water levels necessary for construction activities. Where fishing is currently allowed at Shinn Pond, shore access may be temporarily restricted during construction. Construction notices will be posted near recreational areas and online. \t\t\t         11.   What is the cost of these projects and how will they be funded?    ACWD will invest a total of $40 million for the combined projects in and along Alameda Creek. These projects will allow ACWD to continue operations of rubber dams and water diversion pipelines along the creek to recharge the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner, while still providing about 40 percent of the water supply to the communities of Fremont, Newark and Union City.  These projects are funded through grants, ACWD\u2019s Capital Improvement Program, and the Alameda County Flood Control District (ACFCD). ACFCD is partially funding the Rubber Dam No. 1/Flood Control Drop Structure Fish Ladder Project. \t\t\t         12.   What are the environmental impacts of this project?    Environmental impacts associated with the fish passage improvements have been evaluated and are addressed in an Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Public comments on the MND were accepted and carefully reviewed by ACWD throughout a 30-day public comment period. As the project continues, we will monitor the lakes and creek for impacts on wildlife as outlined in the MND. Although no long-term impacts to the environment are anticipated, a biologist will be onsite to monitor the construction activities for compliance with the MND. \t\t\t         13.   Why are the creek and pond levels so low, and how will this impact fish?     Spring 2013 represents the regions driest conditions on record. As a result, water levels in Grau and Snell Ponds (at Niles Community Park) are at historic lows.  At this time, ACWD is not operating any facilities in Alameda Creek. The current low flow conditions in the creek are a result of natural conditions. During dry years like this one, it is natural to see low water levels in local streams, ponds and lakes.  ACWD understands and shares the public\u2019s concerns expressed about the fate of the fish in the ponds and creek beds as they dry due to weather conditions. The District has been in contact with local fisheries biologists and the Department of Fish and Wildlife about this issue. Because the impacted fish are an invasive, non-native species not protected by the Fish and Game Code, the fish will not be relocated. Ongoing monitoring of the ponds and creek beds will continue in response to natural weather conditions.\t\t\t         14.   How can I get more information?     We are committed to notifying the public in advance of construction activities. Notices will be posted along recreational trails and areas, and construction schedules and staff contact information can be found online at www.acwd.org/Fishway. \t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

These activities can increase the velocity and change the flow direction that water travels through water mains. Sediments lying on the bottom of the mains may get stirred up, resulting in discolored water. \u00a0 Since 1999, ACWD has maintained an annual main cleaning program designed to remove these sediments on a routine basis. \u00a0During periods of drought, as the region experienced in the past few years, ACWD modifies its annual main cleaning program to conserve water. When this program is modified or postponed, as was done in 2022 and 2023, the adjustment causes higher-than-normal amounts of sediment to accumulate on the bottom of the water mains, such that when stirred up, it causes discolored water.\u00a0 ACWD has rescinded its drought ordinance and will resume the regular main cleaning program in the winter of 2024. \u00a0Customers may continue to experience discolored water episodes when conditions mentioned above occur in the water distribution system. \u00a0Please visit the  Discolored Water FAQs  to learn about discolored water and what to do if your drinking water becomes discolored.\u00a0 Despite its appearance, discolored water does not indicate that the integrity of the water main has been compromised. A disinfectant residual is always maintained to ensure that the water continues to meet all state and federal health-based Drinking Water Standards. Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population such as immunocompromised persons, some elderly, and infants. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. \u00a0 \u00a0 In the meantime, ACWD customers may notice a slight discoloration in the drinking water caused by minute levels of the manganese mineral, making the water appear a light yellowish/brownish color. The discolored water is an aesthetic issue and not due to any failure of the water treatment processes. \u00a0 If you would like to learn more about discolored water or have any concerns, please visit our  Discolored Water FAQs , or call us at 510-668-6500.

Why is my drinking water discolored (yellow, brown, black)?    Water main breaks, firefighting activities, extremely high system demand, and the start-up or shut-down of a water treatment facility can increase the velocity at which water travels through water mains. If the water\u2019s speed becomes great enough, iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the mains may get stirred up, resulting in discolored water.           2.   Is discolored water from these activities safe to drink?     Discolored water caused by iron and manganese oxide sediment is safe to drink. During such discolored water episodes, your water continues to meet or surpass all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. ACWD cleans  its water mains  annually to remove sediment, which helps to minimize discolored water episodes. For further details regarding this program, visit the District's  Main Cleaning Program  page.           3.   What should I do if my drinking water becomes discolored?    If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears. To remove the discoloration, flush the pipes in your house using the following procedure:  1. Run the outside front hose faucet at full force for a few minutes or until the water clears. 2. If the water does not clear after a few minutes, wait another hour and repeat the process until the water is clear at the outside front hose faucet. 3.Flush the cold water faucets throughout the house. Start by flushing the cold water faucet in the bathtub. If you are concerned about wasting water, water the backyard from the backyard hose bib for several minutes or until the water clears.  4. After the tub or backyard faucet runs clear, flush all of the other cold water household faucets; starting from the front of the house (nearest the street), then the rest of the cold water faucets within the home.  5. If necessary, remove faucet aerators and clear any particles and then reinstall them. If the water still fails to clear, contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.           4.   After flushing my pipes, my cold water runs clear but my hot water is still discolored. What should I do?    If discolored water has been drawn into the hot water system, the hot water can continue to be used until the discoloration dissipates and is no longer an aesthetic issue. This is generally preferred to draining and refilling the water heater which may require expert help (calling a plumber).  \t\t\t How to flush a water heater           5.   My clothes have been stained by discolored water. What can I do to remove the stains?    You may use commonly available stain removal products that can be purchased at any supermarket. Contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500 if you need further assistance.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}
