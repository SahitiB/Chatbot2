ACWD offers existing fire hydrant flow data to customers free of charge, provided the data is in close proximity to the desired location or project site, and the data is less than 5-years old.\u00a0 ACWD will need to perform a new fire flow test in the event the existing data is older than 5-years, or is no longer representative of the existing ACWD water distribution system.\u00a0 Once the application is submitted, an ACWD Engineering Technician will reach out to you regarding the status of the flow test data, and whether or not a new fire flow test will need to be performed.\u00a0 ACWD charges  $247 per fire flow test . If payment is required, please make the check payable to  Alameda County Water District  and to the address below. Please be sure to attention the envelope or payment to the Alameda County Water District Engineering Department. Alameda County Water District -\u00a0 Engineering Department 43885 South Grimmer Boulevard, Fremont, CA 94538 Although reasonable efforts will be made to perform the fire flow test on the hydrants closest to the requested location, ACWD cannot guarantee that the nearest hydrants will be available for testing. Obstacles (i.e. parked cars, trees, posts, landscaping, etc.) and nozzle configurations or flow orientations may prevent ACWD from flowing particular hydrants.

These activities can increase the velocity and change the flow direction that water travels through water mains. Sediments lying on the bottom of the mains may get stirred up, resulting in discolored water. \u00a0 Since 1999, ACWD has maintained an annual main cleaning program designed to remove these sediments on a routine basis. \u00a0During periods of drought, as the region experienced in the past few years, ACWD modifies its annual main cleaning program to conserve water. When this program is modified or postponed, as was done in 2022 and 2023, the adjustment causes higher-than-normal amounts of sediment to accumulate on the bottom of the water mains, such that when stirred up, it causes discolored water.\u00a0 ACWD has rescinded its drought ordinance and will resume the regular main cleaning program in the winter of 2024. \u00a0Customers may continue to experience discolored water episodes when conditions mentioned above occur in the water distribution system. \u00a0Please visit the  Discolored Water FAQs  to learn about discolored water and what to do if your drinking water becomes discolored.\u00a0 Despite its appearance, discolored water does not indicate that the integrity of the water main has been compromised. A disinfectant residual is always maintained to ensure that the water continues to meet all state and federal health-based Drinking Water Standards. Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population such as immunocompromised persons, some elderly, and infants. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers. \u00a0 \u00a0 In the meantime, ACWD customers may notice a slight discoloration in the drinking water caused by minute levels of the manganese mineral, making the water appear a light yellowish/brownish color. The discolored water is an aesthetic issue and not due to any failure of the water treatment processes. \u00a0 If you would like to learn more about discolored water or have any concerns, please visit our  Discolored Water FAQs , or call us at 510-668-6500.

Algae are microscopic plants that thrive at certain times of the year in rivers and reservoirs. \u00a0The algae is removed from the water in the treatment process, but tiny amounts of compounds can remain behind and cause odors described as \u201cearthy\u201d or \u201cmusty.\u201d   There is no health hazard presented by this phenomenon.

Algae are microscopic plants that thrive at certain times of the year in rivers and reservoirs. \u00a0The algae is removed from the water in the treatment process, but tiny amounts of compounds can remain behind and cause odors described as \u201cearthy\u201d or \u201cmusty.\u201d   There is no health hazard presented by this phenomenon. The water remains safe to drink, cook with and for all other uses.   ACWD is taking immediate steps to address this issue and we expect the problem to clear up in a few days. We are adjusting our water treatment and production processes, including increased ozone treatment. We believe this ozonation process will minimize the unusual tastes and odors some customers have noticed.   Although we don't know how long the conditions in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta may persist, we are working with the California Department of Water Resources, the which operates the State Water Project, as well as neighboring water agencies to monitor and manage this source water issue.

Every governmental agency needs to have a Local Hazard Mitigation Plan approved by CalOES and FEMA in order to be eligible for certain types of pre- and post-disaster grant funding. Without the plan, we cannot\u00a0apply for pre-disaster grant funding that would assist with infrastructure improvements. In addition, the district would not qualify for post-disaster recovery reimbursement. The contents of the plan will have a direct effect on your water district and how it prepares, responds, and recovers from a hazardous event.     The draft plan is available for public review and comment until December 26, 2016.

Just as we\u2019ve prepared, we encourage you to plan ahead and have provided some tools to get you earthquake-ready.  When a major earthquake hits the Bay Area people may be left without water, food, or electricity.  Proper storage of emergency water is crucial to survival and planning ahead will better prepare you and your family. And even with extensive investments to upgrade our water mains, a large quake will damage water mains.  We recommend you store 2 gallons of water per person to use over the course of a week during a disaster. Get the information you need to be prepared and plan ahead. Also be sure to review the Family Disaster Planning Worksheet to assist in creating an emergency supply kit and action plan.

These three sources include water that is diverted from the Alameda Creek Watershed, water purchased from the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (SFPUC), and water purchased from California\u2019s State Water Project.   In an average year, 40% of ACWD\u2019s water supply comes from the Alameda Creek Watershed, 40% from the State Water Project, and 20% from the SFPUC.   ACWD\u2019s local water supply from Alameda Creek has benefitted greatly from the series of rain events this winter.  With local rainfall measuring 117% of normal as of Feb 3, these rain events provided enough water to enable ACWD to fill recharge ponds, and make dramatic improvements in local groundwater levels.  These storms, coupled with ACWD customers excellent conservation practices, have allowed both groundwater and lake levels to fill to targeted storage levels for use in 2016. Since these storage target goals have been met, far less water needs to be diverted to recharge ponds, and customers may notice additional flow in Alameda Creek in the coming winter months.   Although local supplies have reached targeted storage levels, statewide supplies remain challenged. Storage reservoirs around the state of California remain well below normal for this time of year.  ACWD continues to work to optimize usage of these water supplies to ensure there is enough water to deliver to customers during this historic drought. We ask that you continue to conserve water as statewide mandatory water use restrictions remain in effect.

ACWD monitoring wells will be pumped so that groundwater samples can be collected and tested for water quality parameters. This work is necessary because groundwater is a critical source of water that makes up 30 to 60 percent of ACWD\u2019s total water supply. As part of the sampling protocol, a limited amount of groundwater must be removed from the wells and discharged to nearby storm drains. As a result, you may notice water temporarily flowing in the gutters near the sampling sites. ACWD staff have evaluated possible ways of recapturing or reusing the well water removed.  Unfortunately, in most cases, it is not cost effective or technically feasible to do so.

ACWD monitoring wells will be pumped so that groundwater samples can be collected and tested for water quality parameters. This work is necessary because groundwater is a critical source of water that makes up 30 to 60 percent of ACWD\u2019s total water supply. As part of the sampling protocol, a limited amount of groundwater must be removed from the wells and discharged to nearby storm drains. As a result, you may notice water temporarily flowing in the gutters near the sampling sites. ACWD staff have evaluated possible ways of recapturing or reusing the well water removed.  Unfortunately, in most cases, it is not cost effective or technically feasible to do so.  Alternatively, ACWD has taken additional steps to reduce the total amount of water pumped and discharged to better conserve our limited water resources during this time of drought.   Monitoring our groundwater basin is key to protecting our groundwater resources and achieving our mission of providing a reliable supply of high quality water to our customers.

We hope to correct this problem and reduce the possibility of future discolored water episodes by cleaning selected water mains from February 25 - March 11.  In the meantime, we want you to know that your water remains safe to drink and continues to meet all state and federal water quality standards. This discoloration is caused by manganese which is a naturally-occurring mineral in raw water supplies.  Manganese concentrations can vary seasonally and we are currently experiencing higher levels than normal.  This can cause the yellowish tinge. While increased manganese levels may cause your water to look slightly yellow, other events, such as a broken fire hydrant or water main cleaning may temporarily cause a brownish-black discoloration.  If you notice such discoloration, please contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.

Hill Water Agency Award for Excellence The Alameda\u00a0 County Water District has been awarded the prestigious Clair A. Hill Water Agency Award for Excellence from the Association of California Water Agencies for ACWD\u2019s Alameda Creek Fish Passage Improvements Program. \u00a0 The award-winning program is comprised of seven fish passage and water supply projects constructed over two decades along Alameda Creek in Fremont. Meeting the challenge of addressing fish migration and water supply woes, the program and its two innovative fish ladders open up Lower Alameda Creek, allowing migratory fish to bypass obstacles in place since the early 1970s.\u00a0 As a Clair A. Hill Award recipient, ACWD also receives a $5,000 scholarship to be awarded to a deserving student the following year. \u00a0 Creating a More Fish-Friendly Waterway In an effort to restore steelhead trout to Alameda Creek, ACWD and a number of Bay Area agencies have worked for more than a decade to make the creek a more fish-friendly waterway. To improve fish passage through the Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel, ACWD's fish passage projects at its water supply facilities include: the removal of one rubber dam; construction of fish ladders at two rubber dams; and the installation of fishscreens at off-stream diversions. All construction projects are slated for completion by late 2021.

Please review all fields before submitting. \t               Program Details The Alameda County Water District's (ACWD's) Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional (CII) Water Efficient Technology (WET) Program provides an incentive to CII customers to implement equipment changes that reduce water waste. Projects can include onsite water reuse, cooling tower efficiency upgrades, and any other equipment that results in measurable water savings, including custom equipment. Incentive Amount  The incentive amount will be based on annual savings at  $4 per hundred cubic feet [one hundred cubic feet (CCF) is equivalent to 748 gallons]  saved, up to 50% of the cost of equipment . Labor is not included. The incentive amount will cover the cost of qualifying expenses only (materials and equipment costs) paid by the customer up to the maximum incentive amount. Maximums There is a maximum incentive of $10,000 for commercial and industrial customers per site and a $20,000 maximum for industrial customers per site. Application Process Customer completes and submits the CII WET Application below. ACWD will review application to determine if the project meets program requirements. If it does, ACWD will send a Notice to Proceed (NTP).\u00a0 Customer completes project and submits the following required material Receipts/invoices for the purchase of equipment. This documentation must show the date purchased, price of equipment and proof of payment.  Please separate out labor and equipment costs. \u00a0 Photos/videos of installed equipment as proof it is installed and functioning.\u00a0 A W-9 tax form\u00a0 ACWD will inspect these materials to confirm CII WET program requirements were met. If project is complaint, ACWD will issue a check for the project.\u00a0 The recipient will monitor savings and report the measured savings using a simple ACWD template to ACWD one year after the project completion date. Company Information Business Name * Mailing Address * City * State * Zip Code * Installation Address * City * State * Zip Code * Contact Name * Phone * Email * ACWD Account Number(s) * Project Information  Please provide the following information (can be provided on this form or in an attachment that covers all the same information).\u00a0 Project Description  Proposed Start and End Dates Estimated Total Project Cost Please separate out labor and materials.\u00a0 Equipment Life for New Project Components Estimated Annual Water Savings Describe methods used to calculate water savings (or attach calculations) Describe how the water savings will be monitored \u2014 this is required for a minimum of one year Describe the return on investment without any incentives Estimated Annual Savings in addition to water (Sewer, Energy, etc.) Describe any other incentives that the project may be eligible  (e.g., PG&E energy savings incentive) Other water saving measures have already been implemented at the site Project Information  Attachment should cover all information requested in this section (unless provided above) CII WET Program Terms & Conditions/Agreement Measures that are installed prior to application approval are not eligible for the incentive.\u00a0 Volume of existing water use for the measure must be estimated using a reliable and industry accepted method appropriate for the type of project (e.g. submetering).\u00a0 The equipment upgrade must remain in place for the estimated life of equipment or in perpetuity, if the equipment is not expected to expire, to ensure long-term water savings.\u00a0 ACWD reserves the right to conduct an onsite inspection if additional water savings data or project information is needed. Customers must participate in an onsite inspection of equipment or products, if required.\u00a0 Labor and installation costs will not be reimbursed through this incentive program.\u00a0 The CII customer will need to monitor savings and report the measured savings, including photo documentation of achieved savings, to ACWD one year after the project completion date.\u00a0 The maximum incentive amount will be issued in the Notice to Proceed. The maximum incentive authorized prior to project implementation cannot be exceeded, even if water savings achieved is more than what was estimated.\u00a0 ACWD may charge the customer for some, or all, of the incentive amount, at the discretion of ACWD, if the customer does not submit a water savings report after one year, if equipment is removed prior to 5 years after installation, or if the estimated water savings that was used to determine the incentive amount is not achieved.\u00a0 The incentive check may take 6 to 8 weeks to be processed and received after all required documentation is submitted.\u00a0 Incentives may be considered taxable income. Please consult with your tax accountant to determine what impact this may have on your tax situation.\u00a0 I, the undersigned, understand that the Commercial, Industrial, and Institutional (CII) Water Efficient Technology (WET) Program (Program) is a limited, first-come/first-served, one-time program, and that incentives offered through this program are distributed only for projects for which applications are approved in advance of installation. I have read, understand, and will comply with all Program requirements, Terms and Conditions, and understand that ACWD will deny any application that does not meet Program requirements. I understand that I may forfeit any incentive I may receive if I do not keep the equipment in place for at least 5 years or replace the equipment with non-water efficient technology. I have independently selected materials, supplies, and labor for the purpose of performing the installation. I agree that all work performed will comply with applicable state laws, ordinances, and regulations, including any permitting requirements and manufacturer's specifications. I agree that ACWD may visit the premises to inspect existing conditions and to verify that the work has been performed in accordance with all Program requirements. I understand that ACWD's only purpose in making such inspections is to verify compliance with Program requirements and that ACWD does not make any determination with respect to whether materials and equipment are free of defects. the quality of workmanship, or the suitability of the premises or the materials or equipment for the installation. I also understand that the installation of equipment may not result in lower water bills. I agree that I am responsible for any and all liabilities arising from participating in this program and release ACWD from such liabilities. I agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless ACWD, its directors, officers, agents, and employees against any and all loss, liability, expense, claims, suits and damages, including attorney's fees, arising out of or resulting from participation in the Program, including without limitation the installation and use of the equipment or product.\u00a0 I have read, understand, and agree to the terms and conditions of this incentive program.
