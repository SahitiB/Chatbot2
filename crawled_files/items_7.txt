How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.           4.   What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.  The District charges fees for these and other services so the applicable party pays for these costs instead of the general District ratepayer.  While many District fees are designed to recover the full cost the activity, the new $20 field charges for door tags and shutoff are less than the District\u2019s full cost.  Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?     The Alameda County Water District has a long-term financial obligation as a member of the State Water Project and collects a portion of its state water costs on the property tax bill. The amounts collected are adjusted each year based on the District\u2019s state water costs. The State Water Project provides about 40% of the District\u2019s water supply in a typical year.

(If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t               \u25bc  Customers - Customer Service\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?

What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.           4.   What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.  The District charges fees for these and other services so the applicable party pays for these costs instead of the general District ratepayer.  While many District fees are designed to recover the full cost the activity, the new $20 field charges for door tags and shutoff are less than the District\u2019s full cost.  Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?     The Alameda County Water District has a long-term financial obligation as a member of the State Water Project and collects a portion of its state water costs on the property tax bill. The amounts collected are adjusted each year based on the District\u2019s state water costs. The State Water Project provides about 40% of the District\u2019s water supply in a typical year.

Steelhead trout are anadromous fish, living out their adult lives in the ocean and migrating up fresh water streams and rivers to spawn and rear their young. Modifications to the Alameda Creek streambed and urbanization of the surrounding land, however, eliminated spawning areas and made it impossible for steelhead to migrate upstream. As a result, steelhead have been absent from Alameda Creek and its tributaries for several decades. ACWD Fundraising ACWD received $2.1 million from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), and the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to initiate four projects to improve steelhead migration in Alameda Creek. Through the 2005 San Francisco Bay Salmonid Habitat Restoration Fund, NFWF and DWR have helped to fund other projects that will benefit salmon and steelhead trout in central and southern San Francisco Bay watersheds. ACWD's projects are part of a much larger effort to restore steelhead in the Alameda Creek watershed. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, Zone 7 Water Agency, East Bay Regional Park District, and Alameda County Public Works Agency are all involved in projects that will make Alameda Creek a more fish-friendly waterway.

What is a Public Health Goal (PHG)?     A PHG is the level of a chemical contaminant in drinking water that does not pose a significant risk to health. \u00a0PHGs are not regulatory standards. \u00a0However, state law requires the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to set drinking water standards for chemical contaminants as close to the corresponding PHG as is economically and technologically feasible. \u00a0In some cases, it may not be feasible for SWRCB to set drinking water standard for a contaminant at the same level as the PHG. \u00a0The technology to treat the chemicals may not be available, or the cost of treatment may be very high. \u00a0SWRCB must consider these factors when developing a drinking water standard. For more information,  view OEHHA's website           2.   What is a Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG)?     Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) is the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. \u00a0MCLGs allow for a margin of safety and are non-enforceable public health goals. For more information,  view EPA's website           3.   What is a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)?     Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) is the highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to MCLGs as feasible using the best available treatment technology and taking cost into consideration. \u00a0MCLs are enforceable standards.

Home About Us Water Conservation Conservation at Home Water Saving Tips                         Water Saving Tips\t\t               Indoors Find and fix leaks : If you suspect that you have a leak, ACWD can help. We can explain how to do a leak check at the meter, or provide a \"How to Read Your Water Meter\"  brochure  that describes the leak check process. Finding and fixing leaks is the number one thing you can do to save water and money. In the bathroom : Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth, washing your hands, and shaving. Take shorter showers. Install water saving devices such as low flow shower heads and faucet aerators. Replace old toilets with newer, water efficient models. In the kitchen : Run your dishwasher only when you have full loads. Install a low flow faucet aerator. In the laundry room : Run your clothes washer only when you have a full load. Install a high efficiency clothes washer. Outdoors In the garden: Water in the early morning before the sun is overhead. Water your landscaping no more than three days per week in the summer. Water deeply and infrequently to encourage deep roots. Turn your sprinkler system down in the fall, and off in the winter. Use a cycle and soak method to prevent runoff, in other words, run the sprinkler for shorter intervals 2-3 times during the day instead of one long period. Adjust sprinklers to avoid watering the sidewalk or driveway. Install drip irrigation for shrubs, trees and gardens. Use mulch to retain soil moisture. Reduce lawn areas and choose native and  drought tolerant plants  for your landscape. Outside:  Use a shut-off nozzle on your hose. When cleaning your sidewalk or driveway, use a broom instead of a hose. Get your car washed at a commercial car wash that recycles water.

What is the purpose of the Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Program?     The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program is part of the Alameda County Water District\u2019s (District) commitment to delivering reliable drinking water supplies to more than 356,000 people living and working in Fremont, Newark and Union City. The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program will help improve water supply reliability for ACWD customers in the event of a major earthquake and will reduce service interruptions due to aging pipelines. Generally, pipelines have a lifespan of about 75 years, but the risk of a pipeline\u2019s failure increases in proportion with its age. With twenty percent of the District\u2019s pipelines installed before 1960, and the oldest pipelines placed underground in the 1940s, this project represents a major infrastructure improvement for more than 84,000 customers who depend upon reliable water supplies. Proactive pipeline upgrades protect the District and its customers from expensive fixes caused by leaks in the system.           2.   How can I stay up to date on the construction schedule?     The District is prioritizing construction sites in order of risk and project complexity within the overall program budget. Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.           3.   Why are the construction projects spread over multiple years?     All of ACWD\u2019s construction activities must comply with specific permit requirements and must take into account weather conditions and safety precautions. The staggered nature of the construction helps the District maintain reasonable working hours and reduce inconveniences to the public associated with very early and very late construction working hours.           4.   Who is paying for these projects?     The residents and businesses of Fremont, Newark, and Union City who, as ratepayers, contribute to these projects. We want to ensure our customers are aware of how their rate dollars are being used to improve water supply reliability and protect public health and safety. The costs for these projects are being funded in two ways: \u2022 Project costs have been factored into existing rate structures. \u2022 In 2012 ACWD successfully issued $45.2 million in Water Revenue Bonds to restructure existing debt at reduced interest rates and to help finance critical capital projects. By doing so, we are able to make investments in infrastructure while leveraging the District\u2019s excellent AAA bond rating and take advantage of historic low interest rates.           5.   How are you managing construction traffic?      The District is requiring its contractors to ensure that construction traffic is managed effectively and that truck traffic follows posted speed limits. We will have inspectors evaluating the project sites to ensure that rules are enforced and will address any issues that arise.           6.   How will you ensure safety at project sites during construction?     The District will ensure its contractors take precautions to ensure safety during construction, including installing barriers along construction routes, restricting travel speeds and implementing construction safety monitoring during all work. The District will provide project oversight and review during every stage of construction to ensure safety and design requirements are met, including the avoidance of gas lines and other pipelines. In the event of an emergency, the District will implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of surrounding residents, businesses and construction crews.           7.   Will the quality of the water delivered to my home be affected?     The District is committed to monitoring and ensuring water quality standards at all times. During construction, water pipelines may need to be temporarily isolated to accommodate improvements. This action may cause reverse flows in the pipeline, causing iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the pipeline to be stirred up, resulting in discolored water. However, water will remain safe to drink and continue to meet all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears. Please visit ACWD\u2019s website at www.acwd.org to learn how to flush the pipes in your home to remove the discoloration.

However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0                 \u25bc  Drought Resource Center - 2023\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   Does ACWD have enough water?     Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years. More significantly, these recent dry years exhibit characteristics of changed precipitation patterns that are anticipated to occur with climate change \u2013 notably a shorter rainy season and a longer dry season. ACWD is working with water resources managers throughout the state to study and prepare for climate change and develop adaption plans for the new weather patterns; the challenges of today\u2019s drought form a learning opportunity for better management tomorrow \u2013 a silver lining!           3.   How do I take care of my trees?     After several critically dry years, it is important to conserve now to save water for the future. However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0           4.   I\u2019m already saving water. What more can I do to conserve?      Thank you for your efforts to conserve! Although ACWD is no longer experiencing a water shortage emergency, with California\u2019s climate and increasing effects of climate change, every bit of conservation helps, so please continue to reduce. There are simple changes that all Californians can do to save water and ACWD offers a comprehensive suite of water use efficiency measures, such as rebates, technical assistance, and education programs to help. Each one of us can make a difference \u2013 working together as one community to make conservation a way of life in California. \u00a0 \u00a0           5.   How long will the water shortage emergency last and restrictions remain in place?     ACWD's water shortage emergency has been lifted and water use restrictions are no longer in effect.           6.   What is best practice for irrigating my lawn?      ACWD prohibits irrigation runoff so we recommend using a cycle and soak method when irrigating to avoid runoff. A cycle and soak method uses shorter, more frequent cycles of irrigation in one day versus one long runtime. To determine the time you should water for a cycle and soak method, run your irrigation system until you start to see signs of runoff (e.g. water overflowing from landscape onto sidewalk). Then, turn off your irrigation and let the landscape soak for 1 hour and repeat the process 2-3 times. Note the time it takes to begin seeing runoff \u2013 anything applied beyond this time during a single watering event is wasted.\u00a0           7.   I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     If you witness water waste, you can report it to ACWD by completing our Water Waste Reporting Form at  acwd.org/reportwaste  or by calling our Water Use Efficiency team at 510.668.4218. For water emergencies, such as a broken main or fire hydrant, please contact our 24-hour emergency hotline at 510.668.6500.           8.   What is the ban on non-functional turf for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers passed by the State of California?     On June 10, 2022, the State of California\u2019s emergency regulation for urban water conservation prohibiting irrigation of non-functional turf at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties went into effect and was readopted for another year on June 5, 2023. This regulation also prohibits irrigation of non-functional turf in common areas of Homeowners Associations (HOAs). It does not apply to residential properties. Check out the  non-functional turf fact sheet  or visit the  State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information, including a list of  frequently asked questions.  Become future-ready and remove grass and non-functional turf now by taking advantage of ACWD\u2019s Lawn Be Gone Rebate Program.  Learn more.           9.   What is \"non-functional\" turf?     The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?     For an extensive list of water efficient tips and techniques for different types of landscape, check out  ACWD\u2019s Survival Tips for Your Landscape resource . See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule. For more questions regarding the rate and fee schedule, contact customer service at (510) 668 \u2013 4200.\u00a0 You can also\u00a0 review the document here.

Does ACWD have enough water?     Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years.

The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?     For an extensive list of water efficient tips and techniques for different types of landscape, check out  ACWD\u2019s Survival Tips for Your Landscape resource . See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule. For more questions regarding the rate and fee schedule, contact customer service at (510) 668 \u2013 4200.\u00a0 You can also\u00a0 review the document here.

Visitors can enjoy a self-guided tour supported by interpretive signage throughout the garden.\u00a0 Dry sweeping methods or a blower is used \u00a0to remove debris from pavement and walkways located at ACWD facilities  instead of pressure washing . Fleet vehicles are washed at a commercial car wash that recycles water. Drought tolerant landscaping is standard at all ACWD facilities.  Did you know that ACWD customers can receive a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscapes?\u00a0 Please visit  ACWD's Rebate Page  for more information. ACWD staff are certified landscape professionals with earned credentials from Qualified Water-Efficient Landscaper (QWEL) and ReScape (previously Bay-Friendly).  Learn more  about becoming QWEL certified. Before irrigation season, surveys are conducted on all facilities to find and fix outdoor leaks and avoid water waste from overspray, broken sprinkler heads, and broken pipes. Smart irrigation controllers that rely on real-time weather information and other water-efficient technology are installed at District facilities.  Did you know that ACWD customers can receive a rebate for switching to smart irrigation?  Please visit  ACWD's Rebate Page  for more information.

Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years. More significantly, these recent dry years exhibit characteristics of changed precipitation patterns that are anticipated to occur with climate change \u2013 notably a shorter rainy season and a longer dry season. ACWD is working with water resources managers throughout the state to study and prepare for climate change and develop adaption plans for the new weather patterns; the challenges of today\u2019s drought form a learning opportunity for better management tomorrow \u2013 a silver lining!           3.   How do I take care of my trees?     After several critically dry years, it is important to conserve now to save water for the future. However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0           4.   I\u2019m already saving water. What more can I do to conserve?      Thank you for your efforts to conserve! Although ACWD is no longer experiencing a water shortage emergency, with California\u2019s climate and increasing effects of climate change, every bit of conservation helps, so please continue to reduce. There are simple changes that all Californians can do to save water and ACWD offers a comprehensive suite of water use efficiency measures, such as rebates, technical assistance, and education programs to help. Each one of us can make a difference \u2013 working together as one community to make conservation a way of life in California. \u00a0 \u00a0           5.   How long will the water shortage emergency last and restrictions remain in place?     ACWD's water shortage emergency has been lifted and water use restrictions are no longer in effect.           6.   What is best practice for irrigating my lawn?      ACWD prohibits irrigation runoff so we recommend using a cycle and soak method when irrigating to avoid runoff. A cycle and soak method uses shorter, more frequent cycles of irrigation in one day versus one long runtime. To determine the time you should water for a cycle and soak method, run your irrigation system until you start to see signs of runoff (e.g. water overflowing from landscape onto sidewalk). Then, turn off your irrigation and let the landscape soak for 1 hour and repeat the process 2-3 times. Note the time it takes to begin seeing runoff \u2013 anything applied beyond this time during a single watering event is wasted.\u00a0           7.   I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     If you witness water waste, you can report it to ACWD by completing our Water Waste Reporting Form at  acwd.org/reportwaste  or by calling our Water Use Efficiency team at 510.668.4218. For water emergencies, such as a broken main or fire hydrant, please contact our 24-hour emergency hotline at 510.668.6500.           8.   What is the ban on non-functional turf for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers passed by the State of California?     On June 10, 2022, the State of California\u2019s emergency regulation for urban water conservation prohibiting irrigation of non-functional turf at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties went into effect and was readopted for another year on June 5, 2023. This regulation also prohibits irrigation of non-functional turf in common areas of Homeowners Associations (HOAs). It does not apply to residential properties. Check out the  non-functional turf fact sheet  or visit the  State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information, including a list of  frequently asked questions.  Become future-ready and remove grass and non-functional turf now by taking advantage of ACWD\u2019s Lawn Be Gone Rebate Program.  Learn more.           9.   What is \"non-functional\" turf?     The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?     For an extensive list of water efficient tips and techniques for different types of landscape, check out  ACWD\u2019s Survival Tips for Your Landscape resource . See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule.

Does ACWD have enough water?     Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years. More significantly, these recent dry years exhibit characteristics of changed precipitation patterns that are anticipated to occur with climate change \u2013 notably a shorter rainy season and a longer dry season. ACWD is working with water resources managers throughout the state to study and prepare for climate change and develop adaption plans for the new weather patterns; the challenges of today\u2019s drought form a learning opportunity for better management tomorrow \u2013 a silver lining!           3.   How do I take care of my trees?     After several critically dry years, it is important to conserve now to save water for the future. However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0           4.   I\u2019m already saving water. What more can I do to conserve?      Thank you for your efforts to conserve! Although ACWD is no longer experiencing a water shortage emergency, with California\u2019s climate and increasing effects of climate change, every bit of conservation helps, so please continue to reduce. There are simple changes that all Californians can do to save water and ACWD offers a comprehensive suite of water use efficiency measures, such as rebates, technical assistance, and education programs to help. Each one of us can make a difference \u2013 working together as one community to make conservation a way of life in California. \u00a0 \u00a0           5.   How long will the water shortage emergency last and restrictions remain in place?     ACWD's water shortage emergency has been lifted and water use restrictions are no longer in effect.           6.   What is best practice for irrigating my lawn?      ACWD prohibits irrigation runoff so we recommend using a cycle and soak method when irrigating to avoid runoff. A cycle and soak method uses shorter, more frequent cycles of irrigation in one day versus one long runtime. To determine the time you should water for a cycle and soak method, run your irrigation system until you start to see signs of runoff (e.g. water overflowing from landscape onto sidewalk). Then, turn off your irrigation and let the landscape soak for 1 hour and repeat the process 2-3 times. Note the time it takes to begin seeing runoff \u2013 anything applied beyond this time during a single watering event is wasted.\u00a0           7.   I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     If you witness water waste, you can report it to ACWD by completing our Water Waste Reporting Form at  acwd.org/reportwaste  or by calling our Water Use Efficiency team at 510.668.4218. For water emergencies, such as a broken main or fire hydrant, please contact our 24-hour emergency hotline at 510.668.6500.           8.   What is the ban on non-functional turf for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers passed by the State of California?     On June 10, 2022, the State of California\u2019s emergency regulation for urban water conservation prohibiting irrigation of non-functional turf at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties went into effect and was readopted for another year on June 5, 2023. This regulation also prohibits irrigation of non-functional turf in common areas of Homeowners Associations (HOAs). It does not apply to residential properties. Check out the  non-functional turf fact sheet  or visit the  State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information, including a list of  frequently asked questions.

The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?     For an extensive list of water efficient tips and techniques for different types of landscape, check out  ACWD\u2019s Survival Tips for Your Landscape resource . See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule. For more questions regarding the rate and fee schedule, contact customer service at (510) 668 \u2013 4200.\u00a0 You can also\u00a0 review the document here.

What is lead?    Lead is a metal found in natural deposits and can be found in all parts of our environment, indoors and out. Lead was commonly used in older household plumbing materials until 1986 when the plumbing rules changed and required pipes, fittings and fixtures to be \u201clead-free.\u201d  The most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach lead into the water, especially hot water. \t\t\t         2.   How does it get into drinking water?    Lead can get into drinking water when service lines, household pipes, or household fixtures corrode, but ACWD is fortunate in that we do not have lead service lines and our source water does not contain lead.  Our corrosion control program, described below, helps to limit leaching of lead by preventing the corrosion of household pipes and fixtures.\t\t\t         3.   What is ACWD doing to keep lead out of my water?    Since the 1990s ACWD has been proactively monitoring and adjusting the water quality, specifically pH, at our treatment plants daily so the water is not corrosive to household pipes and plumbing fixtures. In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t\t         4.   How do I know ACWD's Corrosion Control Program is working?    The results of our 2015 testing demonstrates that our Corrosion Control Program is effective.  Every three years we work with at least 50 homeowners to collect a water sample from inside their homes. These samples are considered to be worst-case scenario because they are collected after the water has been still for at least 6 hours (so the water is in contact with the household plumbing for a long time), and the home\u2019s plumbing was in place before the 1986 lead ban (so the plumbing is more likely to have lead). These samples are analyzed by our State-certified laboratory and results are reported to the California Division of Drinking Water, our Board of Directors, the public, and most importantly the homeowners who collected samples.  As part of our compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, these results are compared to the Action Level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). ACWD is in compliance with the Lead Action Level because 90% or more of our samples are below the 15 ppb Action Level. In 2015, 90% of our samples were 8.1 ppb of lead or less. \t\t\t         5.   What can I do to keep lead out of my water?    Even with an effective Corrosion Control Program in place, customers may choose to take steps on their own to further minimize the potential for lead in drinking water, including:  - Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing  baby formula.  - Run the water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby formula. This water is great to use for watering plants! - Consider using a certified water filter to remove lead. Be sure to check that it is certified for lead removal. - Replace old plumbing or fixtures that may have lead. Lead pipes will have a dull gray look and can easily be scratched by a key.\t\t\t         6.   Can you test my water for me?     ACWD does not test customer's water for lead on a regular basis. However, select homes are tested for our Lead and Copper Rule compliance every three years. Although testing has concluded for 2018, we will be testing again in 2021. You can have your water tested by any state-certified lab. ACWD provides as a courtesy to its customers a list of local state-certified commercial laboratories.

Does ACWD fluoridate its water?     Yes, voters required\u00a0the addition of fluoride in the early 1970\u2019s and ACWD began fluoridating drinking water in 1976.           2.   Why do you fluoridate the drinking water?    Fluoride is added to your drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. Although fluoride is found naturally in almost all water sources, it is generally not enough to provide oral health benefits. Drinking fluoridated water benefits the whole community, including people of all ages and especially low-income and underserved populations. \t\t\t         3.   What is fluoride?    Fluoride is a naturally-occurring element found in rocks and soil. As water passes through and over soil and rock formations containing fluoride, the fluoride dissolves into the water.\t\t\t         4.   How much fluoride is added to my water?    ACWD supplements the naturally-occurring fluoride in your drinking water to meet the California State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Drinking Water (DDW) recommended optimal level of 0.7 parts per million (ppm). Samples are collected daily to ensure that the fluoride level is within the State-specified control range of 0.6-1.2 ppm.\t\t\t         5.   How does ACWD monitor the fluoride level in my water?    ACWD uses continuous monitoring equipment at each of its treatment facilities. Water samples are also collected and analyzed daily from 53 locations throughout the service area. Compliance reports are submitted monthly to the DDW, the Alameda County Public Health Department, and the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency. \t\t\t         6.   What do health professionals say about fluoride?    Medical and dental experts endorse water fluoridation as the single most effective public health measure to improve oral health. For over 65 years, drinking fluoridated water has been scientifically proven to be safe and effective.  Local, state, and national health organizations emphasize the benefits of fluoridation for community prevention of tooth decay and maintain that fluoride poses no health threat. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention proclaimed fluoridation to be one of the top ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.           7.   What are the regulations on fluoridating drinking water?    Assembly Bill 733, signed into law in 1995, requires large water systems to fluoridate their public water supplies. It also directs DDW to seek funding for fluoridation. In April 1998, DDW adopted regulations to enforce the water fluoridation requirements in AB 733.  Senate Bill 96, passed in 2004, further reinforced community water fluoridation as a statewide public health priority and preempted local regulations.            8.   Do statewide regulations regarding fluoridation apply to ACWD?    Yes, statewide regulations apply to large water systems with at least 10,000 service connections and require that:  Large systems with existing fluoridation practices continue fluoridating, and  Large non-fluoridated systems start fluoridating when funding is made available  ACWD delivers water to over 80,000 service connections and is required to fluoridate in order to stay compliant.           9.   Should I use fluoride supplements?    Drinking fluoridated water on a regular basis makes the use of fluoride supplements unnecessary. Simultaneous use of fluoride supplements and drinking fluoridated water is not recommended by health professionals. Contact your health care or dental care provider if you have questions about fluoride supplements. \t\t\t         10.   Is fluoride okay for my pets?    Fluoride in levels administered for drinking water is safe for humans and all animals. Fluoridated water has no effect on the growth of tropical fish or goldfish. Research and experience have shown that fluoridation at optimal levels does not harm people or the environment. \t\t\t         11.   If I have water filter, is it removing the fluoride?    To find out if fluoride is being removed, check with the filter manufacturer. Typically, carafe filters, faucet filters, and carbon filters do not remove fluoride.\t\t\t         12.   If I do not want to drink fluoridated tap water, how can I remove the fluoride?    There are four different ways to remove fluoride from tap water: activated alumina filters, distillation, reverse osmosis, and anion exchange. No treatment method will remove all of the fluoride. Consult with the manufacturers on the amount of fluoride their products can remove.  The most effective whole house filtration method for removing fluoride is reverse osmosis which has up to 80-90% efficiency. Water distillation systems remove up to 100% of fluoride, and bottled water does not generally contain fluoride.  The following products or procedures will NOT remove fluoride:  - Activated carbon filters - Water softeners - Boiling water - concentrates fluoride rather than reduces it.  - Refrigerating or freezing water - has no effect on the concentration of fluoride in the water            13.   Which organizations endorse water fluoridation?    The following organizations endorse fluoridation as an important public health measure for reducing tooth decay:  - The American Dental Association  - The American Medical Association  - The American Water Works Association - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - California Department of Public Health - Alameda County Public Health Department \t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Does ACWD have enough water?     Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years. More significantly, these recent dry years exhibit characteristics of changed precipitation patterns that are anticipated to occur with climate change \u2013 notably a shorter rainy season and a longer dry season. ACWD is working with water resources managers throughout the state to study and prepare for climate change and develop adaption plans for the new weather patterns; the challenges of today\u2019s drought form a learning opportunity for better management tomorrow \u2013 a silver lining!           3.   How do I take care of my trees?     After several critically dry years, it is important to conserve now to save water for the future. However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0           4.   I\u2019m already saving water. What more can I do to conserve?      Thank you for your efforts to conserve! Although ACWD is no longer experiencing a water shortage emergency, with California\u2019s climate and increasing effects of climate change, every bit of conservation helps, so please continue to reduce. There are simple changes that all Californians can do to save water and ACWD offers a comprehensive suite of water use efficiency measures, such as rebates, technical assistance, and education programs to help. Each one of us can make a difference \u2013 working together as one community to make conservation a way of life in California. \u00a0 \u00a0           5.   How long will the water shortage emergency last and restrictions remain in place?     ACWD's water shortage emergency has been lifted and water use restrictions are no longer in effect.           6.   What is best practice for irrigating my lawn?      ACWD prohibits irrigation runoff so we recommend using a cycle and soak method when irrigating to avoid runoff. A cycle and soak method uses shorter, more frequent cycles of irrigation in one day versus one long runtime. To determine the time you should water for a cycle and soak method, run your irrigation system until you start to see signs of runoff (e.g. water overflowing from landscape onto sidewalk). Then, turn off your irrigation and let the landscape soak for 1 hour and repeat the process 2-3 times. Note the time it takes to begin seeing runoff \u2013 anything applied beyond this time during a single watering event is wasted.\u00a0           7.   I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     If you witness water waste, you can report it to ACWD by completing our Water Waste Reporting Form at  acwd.org/reportwaste  or by calling our Water Use Efficiency team at 510.668.4218. For water emergencies, such as a broken main or fire hydrant, please contact our 24-hour emergency hotline at 510.668.6500.           8.   What is the ban on non-functional turf for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers passed by the State of California?     On June 10, 2022, the State of California\u2019s emergency regulation for urban water conservation prohibiting irrigation of non-functional turf at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties went into effect and was readopted for another year on June 5, 2023. This regulation also prohibits irrigation of non-functional turf in common areas of Homeowners Associations (HOAs). It does not apply to residential properties. Check out the  non-functional turf fact sheet  or visit the  State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information, including a list of  frequently asked questions.  Become future-ready and remove grass and non-functional turf now by taking advantage of ACWD\u2019s Lawn Be Gone Rebate Program.  Learn more.           9.   What is \"non-functional\" turf?     The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?

See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule. For more questions regarding the rate and fee schedule, contact customer service at (510) 668 \u2013 4200.\u00a0 You can also\u00a0 review the document here.

How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   How do I disinfect a drain?    The odor of rotten eggs or sewage in the water is usually caused by sewer gases forming in the household drain. These gases are formed by bacteria which live on food, soap, hair, and other organic matter in the drain. These gases are heavier than air and remain in the drain until the water is turned on. As the water runs down the drain, the gases are expelled into the atmosphere around the sink. It is natural to associate these odors with the water because they are observed only when the water is turned on. However, the odor is not in the water, it is simply the water pushing the gas out of the drain.  Disinfecting the drain will remove the bacteria in the drain that are causing these foul odors.  Caution: do not mix any drain cleaners or detergents with bleach; certain combinations can create toxic fumes.  1. Run the cold water for about 15 seconds into the drain that is to be disinfected, then turn the water off.  2. Pour approximately one to two cups of liquid chlorine bleach (laundry bleach) down the drain. Pour the bleach slowly around the edges of the drain so that it runs down the sides of the drain. Be careful: bleach may cause eye damage, skin irritation, and may damage clothing. 3. If the odor is coming from a sink with a garbage disposal, turn the disposal on for a few seconds while the bleach is being poured. This will disperse the bleach around the inside of the disposal. Caution: take care to avoid splashing for the few seconds the disposal is turned on. Bleach may cause eye damage, skin irritation, and may damage clothing.  4. Allow the bleach to remain undisturbed in the drain for about 10 minutes. Caution: prolonged contact with metals may cause pitting and/or discoloration.  5. After 10 minutes, run hot water into the drain for a minute or two to flush out the bleach. If a garbage disposal was disinfected, thoroughly flush it as well.  6. Repeat this procedure if the odor returns.            3.   How do I heat-disinfect my water heater?    A sulfurous or rotten egg-like odor in the hot water is caused by bacteria growing in the water heater. This growth usually happens when the water heater is turned off while on vacation, when the hot water has not been used for a long time, or when the temperature setting on the heater is set too low. While the bacteria in the water heater are not a health threat, they must be eliminated to remove the odor problem. Heat disinfection is used to eliminate the bacteria. It involves draining the water heater, maximizing the temperature in the water heater, and then draining the water heater again.  If you do not feel comfortable doing this work yourself, hire a licensed plumber to do it for you.  1. Select a time to drain the water heater. We recommend an evening since this will minimize the impact your typical use of hot water. 2. Turn the thermostat on the heater off so that only the pilot light remains on. If the heater is drained while the heating flame is on, the heater may be damaged.  3. Turn off the water supply to the water heater. There may be a valve to do this right at the inlet to the water heater, or the water supply to the entire property may need to be shut off at the house valve.  4. Open one or more hot water faucets inside the house. This allows air to enter the heater as the water drains out in step 6.  5. Attach a garden hose to the draincock located at the bottom of the water heater. The draincock usually looks like a regular hose bib (garden faucet) or a round dial with a threaded hole in the middle.  6. Extend the garden hose to a place where the water can be disposed of (e.g. a drain, the driveway, etc.).  7. Open the draincock and allow all of the water to drain out of the water heater. This can take anywhere from five minutes to half an hour or more depending on the capacity of the heater and the size of the draincock. Caution: the draining water will be very hot. Also note that if the draincock is made of plastic and the water heater is several years old, it may be difficult to open and may break easily if forced.  8. When the water heater is empty, close the draincock and remove the garden hose.  9. Turn the water supply to the water heater back on. Leave the hot water faucet(s) inside the house turned on. This will allow the air in the water heater to escape as it refills with water. There will likely be \"hissing\" sounds and/or \"spitting and sputtering\" as air and water begin coming out of the hot water faucets. When the water flow from the faucet(s) returns to normal, shut them off.  10. That night (before going to bed), turn the thermostat for the water heater to its highest temperature setting for one night. Caution: make sure everyone who uses the water is aware that the hot water is going to be hotter than usual.  11. The next morning, turn the thermostat on the heater off so that only the pilot light remains on. If the heater is drained while the heating flame is on, the heater may be damaged.  12. Drain and refill the water heater by repeating steps 2 through 8.  13. Return the thermostat on the water heater to the normal setting (usually around 130\u00b0F).            4.   How do I flush a water heater?    Water heaters should be flushed at least once a year - twice a year is even better - to control the build-up of mineral deposits. The water heater will operate more fuel efficiently and will last longer.  The water heater will also need to be flushed if the hot water becomes yellow or brown due to an accumulation of rust or if you find sand-like mineral sediment in the hot water.  If you do not feel comfortable doing this work yourself, hire a licensed plumber to do it for you. 1. Do not shut off the gas or the water supply to the heater.  2. Attach a garden hose to the draincock located at the bottom of the heater. The draincock usually looks like a regular hose bib (garden faucet) or a round dial with a threaded hole in the middle.  3. Extend the garden hose to a place where the water can safely exit the heater (e.g. a drain, a driveway, etc.).  4. Open the draincock to allow the water to exit the heater. Caution: the water leaving the heater will be hot and under normal household water pressure. Also note that if the draincock is made of plastic and the heater is several years old, it may be difficult to open and may break easily if forced.  5. After five minutes of flushing, fill a bucket with the still flushing water.  6. Allow the water in the bucket to stand undisturbed for a minute and see if the water has cleared or if any sand-like material settles to the bottom. If the water has cleared and no sand-like material is observed, go on to step 7. If the water is discolored and/or sand-like material is observed at the bottom of the bucket, repeat steps 5 and 6 until the water is completely clear and free of sediment.  7. Close the draincock and remove the garden hose.            5.   I have a leak at my meter. Who is responsible for this repair, me or ACWD?    ACWD is responsible for the materials and water quality up to and including the customers\u2019 water meter.  The customer is responsible for the materials on their side of the meter including the service line and all of the building\u2019s internal plumbing.

Why is my drinking water discolored (yellow, brown, black)?    Water main breaks, firefighting activities, extremely high system demand, and the start-up or shut-down of a water treatment facility can increase the velocity at which water travels through water mains. If the water\u2019s speed becomes great enough, iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the mains may get stirred up, resulting in discolored water.           2.   Is discolored water from these activities safe to drink?     Discolored water caused by iron and manganese oxide sediment is safe to drink. During such discolored water episodes, your water continues to meet or surpass all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. ACWD cleans  its water mains  annually to remove sediment, which helps to minimize discolored water episodes. For further details regarding this program, visit the District's  Main Cleaning Program  page.           3.   What should I do if my drinking water becomes discolored?    If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears. To remove the discoloration, flush the pipes in your house using the following procedure:  1. Run the outside front hose faucet at full force for a few minutes or until the water clears. 2. If the water does not clear after a few minutes, wait another hour and repeat the process until the water is clear at the outside front hose faucet. 3.Flush the cold water faucets throughout the house. Start by flushing the cold water faucet in the bathtub. If you are concerned about wasting water, water the backyard from the backyard hose bib for several minutes or until the water clears.  4. After the tub or backyard faucet runs clear, flush all of the other cold water household faucets; starting from the front of the house (nearest the street), then the rest of the cold water faucets within the home.  5. If necessary, remove faucet aerators and clear any particles and then reinstall them. If the water still fails to clear, contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.           4.   After flushing my pipes, my cold water runs clear but my hot water is still discolored. What should I do?    If discolored water has been drawn into the hot water system, the hot water can continue to be used until the discoloration dissipates and is no longer an aesthetic issue. This is generally preferred to draining and refilling the water heater which may require expert help (calling a plumber).  \t\t\t How to flush a water heater           5.   My clothes have been stained by discolored water. What can I do to remove the stains?    You may use commonly available stain removal products that can be purchased at any supermarket.

Can water flow backward?    Yes. Water, like electricity, takes the path of least resistance from a higher pressure to a lower pressure. Normally, water flows directly from our mains to your property, but in certain situations, such as a main break, water can flow back into the distribution system. \t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.           4.   What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.  The District charges fees for these and other services so the applicable party pays for these costs instead of the general District ratepayer.  While many District fees are designed to recover the full cost the activity, the new $20 field charges for door tags and shutoff are less than the District\u2019s full cost.  Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?     The Alameda County Water District has a long-term financial obligation as a member of the State Water Project and collects a portion of its state water costs on the property tax bill. The amounts collected are adjusted each year based on the District\u2019s state water costs. The State Water Project provides about 40% of the District\u2019s water supply in a typical year.

Why is chlorine added to the tap water?    Chlorine disinfection is used to kill microbes that could be harmful to your health.  It is an important treatment process that ensures your tap water is safe to drink.\t\t\t         2.   What are chlorination byproducts?    Chlorination byproducts are chemical compounds formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter in water. Total trihalomethanes are a specific group of regulated compounds formed when chlorination is practiced.\t\t\t         3.   What steps has ACWD taken to ensure that chlorination byproducts are minimized?    1. Routinely controlling and monitoring water treatment processes to limit the formation of chlorination byproducts.  2. Monitoring for total trihalomethanes at representative locations throughout the distribution system as required by State and federal regulations.  3. Reviewing the latest regulations and health effects information, and employing improved treatment strategies to ensure that facilities are operated to further limit the formation of chlorination byproducts. \t\t\t         4.   Does ACWD meet current state and federal regulations for total trihalomethanes?    Yes.

Why are chloramines toxic to fish?     Chloramines are safe for humans but toxic to fish.  When chloramines, a combination of chlorine and ammonia, break down either naturally or through the use chlorine removing chemicals, ammonia is released.  The ammonia can be removed from fish tanks or ponds by using commercial products available at pet supply stores.  Biological filters, natural zeolites and pH control methods are also effective in reducing the toxic effects of ammonia.\t\t\t         2.   Are chloramines toxic to both saltwater and freshwater fish?    Yes. Chloramines affect saltwater fish in the same way they affect freshwater fish.\t\t\t         3.   Do chloramines pose a hazard to koi?    Yes. Koi are just as susceptible to chloramines as other fish.\t\t\t         4.   Will letting water sit for a few days cause chloramines to disappear?    No. Unlike chlorine, which dissipates when water sits for a few days, chloramines may take weeks to disappear. \t\t\t         5.   Do chloramines have to be removed if only a small amount of water is added to an aquarium or pond to make up for evaporation loss?    To know for sure, you'll have to monitor for total chlorine residual. Chloramine residuals in water used to keep fish should be kept below 0.1 mg/L. Total chlorine test kits are available from pet stores, pool supply stores and chemical supply houses. Make sure, however, that the kit is for \"total chlorine\" or \"combined chlorine,\" not \"free chlorine.\" A free chlorine test of chloraminated water would read zero but still be toxic to fish.\t\t\t         6.   Will a carbon filter remove chloramines?    No. Most carbon filters will not remove chloramines.\t\t\t         7.   Will reverse osmosis remove chloramines?    No. Salts can be caught by the permeable membrane but chloramines pass through easily.\t\t\t         8.   Will boiling remove chloramines from water?    No. Boiling is not an effective way to remove chloramines from water. The only practical methods of removing chloramines from water are using a water conditioner which contains a dechloraminator or by using a granular activated carbon. Ask your pet supplier for instructions on how to use these products.\t\t\t         9.   Who can I contact if I have additional questions about chloramines?    If you have questions or comments about chloramination, please contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

What is AutoPay?    AutoPay is a convenient option in which bills will be paid automatically each billing cycle on the due date using your default credit card or bank account. This will avoid any late fees and free you from having to remember when to pay. On or after July 9, login to your account and click on AutoPay to enroll. Enrolling in AutoPay and Paperless billing is the most convenient and environmentally friendly option for receiving and paying your water bill.\t\t\t         2.   What if I already have AutoPay set up with my bank?    You will want to contact your bank and cancel your automated bank draft before the payment is due and then you can choose to enroll in AutoPay using a credit/debit card or bank account through our online payment portal.\t\t\t         3.   What are scheduled payments?    Scheduled payments are individual payments that are scheduled for a specific date prior to the bill due date. Scheduled payments can be changed if it is before the date scheduled.\t\t\t         4.   What is the difference between AutoPay and a scheduled payment?    AutoPay is an automated process which pays your balance in full each billing cycle. Scheduled payments are manually entered by you for the date you choose.\t\t\t         5.   I\u2019m signed up for AutoPay but do not see anything showing under \u201cUpcoming Scheduled Payments.\u201d    The AutoPay date will not appear on the home page under Upcoming Scheduled Payments. However, when on the Scheduled Payments page, AutoPay will show. AutoPay payments will be made on the due date of the water bill.\t\t\t         6.   Can I cancel AutoPay?    Yes, simply login to your account and click on AutoPay. Next, select Edit and change the status to \u201cNo, I do not want AutoPay\u201d and save.\t\t\t         7.   If I sign up to Go Paperless, how will I receive my bills?    You will receive an email notification each time a new bill is ready for you to view and pay. Email notifications go to the email address used when you registered. A courtesy email address may be added if you wish to send notifications to an additional email address. As a convenience, a reminder email will be sent a few days before the due date if a payment has not been received or scheduled.\t\t\t         8.   Can I start receiving paper bills again?    Yes, simply login and click on Paperless. Then, select \u201cNo\u201d and save your changes.\t\t\t         9.   What is Account Linking?    Account Linking means that payers can link multiple accounts and view and pay all open bills in a single transaction. When registering bills under the same email address, payers are given the option to link the related accounts within the service. Multiple first email notifications scheduled for the same day, including for different bill types, are grouped into one email rather than sent separately. Payment receipts are sent individually. Editing account information such as changing an email or password will go across all linked accounts; however, changing settings such as AutoPay or paperless is only for the accessed account.\t\t\t         10.   What is Pay by Text?    Pay by Text is a convenient way to pay your bill by text message. When signed up for Pay by Text, bill notifications will be sent by text message (this is in addition to email notifications) and you will then have the option to pay by text message with your default payment method with a quick reply. You may sign up for Pay by Text (on or after July 9) when making an online payment or by accessing your account and selecting the Pay by Text option. A confirmation text will be sent to complete enrollment.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

I forgot my Password, how do I access my account?    To reset your password, simply go to the \u2018Forgot Password\u2019 page on the new online system.\t\t\t         8.   I received an email related to my bill, but it\u2019s not from an ACWD email address.  Who is invoicecloud.net?    ACWD has partnered with a company called Invoice Cloud to provide new and enhanced billing and payment options for ACWD customers.

How long will my payment history be maintained?    Payment history will be maintained up to 24-months.\t\t\t         11.   Why do you need the last four digits of my social security number?

Will I be able to print a copy of my bill?    Yes, each invoice is presented in PDF format and viewable for up to 24-months. Electronic storage is recommended because it saves paper and has a beneficial impact on our environment, but you can choose to print your bill.\t\t\t         13.   Why can\u2019t I view my bills prior to July 2018?    In making this important upgrade, billing history was not carried forward to the new system. Moving forward, customers will be able to view up to 24 months of billing history.\t\t\t         14.   Who do I contact with questions about my bill or if I\u2019m having trouble using the online system?    Please contact us at (510) 668-4200 and we will do our best to assist you.\t\t\t         15.   I accidentally deleted my current email notification, what should I do?    If you are registered, you can log in to the online payment portal to view your bill. Or, you can call us at (510 668-4200 and ask to resend the email.\t\t\t         16.   Is my information secure?    Invoice Cloud, the company ACWD has partnered with to provide these services, uses the highest standards in internet security. Account information displayed within the customer and biller portals is truncated (abbreviated) to protect confidential data. Any information retained is not shared with third parties. \t\t\t         17.   Is my credit card and checking account information safe when I pay online?    Absolutely.  Invoice Cloud will safely store your financial information using Payment Card Industry (PCI) Compliant systems. This includes truncating (abbreviating) account numbers so that even the biller does not see your complete account information.\t\t\t         18.   What is PCI Compliance and why is it so important?    PCI stands for Payment Card Industry, and compliance with the industry standards is a requirement for those that accept the major credit cards and for software providers who have applications which involve the transmission and/or storage of credit card information. \t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Why is ACWD upgrading its online billing and payment system?    We\u2019ve heard our customers \u2013 they want more options in choosing how to pay, and greater ease of use, with fewer fees and less paper. This upgrade will provide a number of new and improved payment options without fees, including paperless billing. At the same time, it will make processing customer payments more efficient.\t\t\t         2.   When is the change taking place?    The upgraded system will be available for all types of billing & payments starting July 9, 2018.\t\t\t         3.   How will I be affected?    > Current AutoPay and e-Bill customers will have to enroll in the new system to continue using existing and improved services. In order to make this important upgrade, ACWD must deactivate all current online billing and AutoPay enrollments in July. Customers who wish to use the new and enhanced services will have to re-enroll. We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause, but the new and enhanced services will provide greater ease and convenience for billing and payment options. Thank you for your understanding as we make this important upgrade. > Customers may enroll in the new online system starting July 9. In order to make this important upgrade with the least disruption to customers, the upgraded system can\u2019t be made available until July 9. Customers can enroll as soon as it becomes available. > You will need to have your account information to enroll, so keep your current bill for quick reference. To enroll in AutoPay, e-Bill, and other services, you will need your account name and number, ZIP code, and the last four digits of the social security number associated with the account.\t\t\t         4.   Are there fees for paying online?    There are no service fees for paying through ACWD\u2019s upgraded online system.\t\t\t         5.   How do I enroll?    Your first bill after July 9 and ACWD\u2019s website will include instructions on how to enroll with your email address. You will also need your ACWD account number to register.\t\t\t         6.   I don\u2019t want to enroll. Can I still make a payment online?    Yes! You can make a one-time online payment at any time without having to enroll. You will still need an email address and your account name and number.\t\t\t         7.   Why do I have to re-enroll in AutoPay or to receive an e-Bill?    In order to make this important upgrade, for a number of business reasons ACWD must deactivate all current online billing and AutoPay enrollments in July. Customers who wish to keep these services will have to re-enroll in the upgraded system with an email address. We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause, but the new services available to customers will provide ease and convenience for bill payment options. Thank you for your understanding as we make this important upgrade.\t\t\t         8.   Why can\u2019t I enroll now?    In order to make this important upgrade with the least disruption to customers, ACWD must make the switch over to the upgraded system within a very short time period. The upgraded system can\u2019t be made available until this switch is made, but customers can enroll as soon as it becomes available on July 9.\t\t\t         9.   Will I still be able to view my bill from my bank website?    In order to make this upgrade, this service must be terminated, but may be reactivated at a later date. Bills can always be viewed by registering your account. Additionally, bills may still be paid using your bank website where available.\t\t\t         10.   What are some of the benefits of receiving my bill electronically?    It is convenient, saves time, you can receive email or text reminders of due dates, and it allows you to receive bills and make payments anywhere at any time. Plus, by reducing the amount of paper generated, it helps the environment!\t\t\t         11.   What are some of the benefits of paying a bill online?    Paying online with a credit/debit card or electronic check gives you the flexibility to pay how and when desired, and saves you the trouble from writing and mailing a check or driving by our office. In addition, you may choose to store your information for future use and pay by text message on your phone.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

What is the purpose of the projects along Alameda Creek?     The projects along Alameda Creek will allow steelhead trout and other threatened/endangered fish species to more easily and safely migrate upstream and downstream. At the same time, they will allow us to maintain reliable water supplies for residents and businesses in Fremont, Newark, and Union City.           2.   Why is ACWD concerned about fish in Alameda Creek?     Steelhead trout are a federally listed threatened species. Modifications to the Alameda Creek streambed and urbanization of the surrounding region have eliminated spawning areas and made it impossible for steelhead to migrate upstream. As a result, steelhead trout have been absent from Alameda Creek and its tributaries for several decades. Without implementing these projects, we would have to significantly curtail our groundwater recharge operations, limiting our ability to maintain reliable water supplies from Alameda Creek. \t\t\t         3.   How will these projects improve fish passage?     Threatened steelhead trout utilize Alameda Creek to migrate to/from the ocean on a journey that is an important part of our ecosystem. ACWD is working to enhance the migration conditions for steelhead trout by installing state-of-the-art fish screens and ladders.\t\t\t         4.   Who is involved?     ACWD is part of a regional effort focused on protecting the needs of threatened/endangered fish. Other partners include the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, Zone 7 Water Agency, East Bay Regional Park District, and Alameda County Public Works Agency, ACWD\u2019s efforts to improve steelhead passage through Alameda Creek represent a critical link in the greater Bay Area and northern California restoration efforts.\t\t\t         5.   When and where will construction take place?    ACWD\u2019s ongoing commitment to environmental and wildlife protection includes the construction of several projects along Alameda Creek. These projects span several years --- several projects have been completed with projects continuing into 2021. Up-to-date project locations and schedules can be found at: www.acwd.org/Fishway.   We will strive to limit construction hours to Monday-Friday between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., but construction may also occur on Saturdays and Sundays or at night, as needed. We will post notices where construction will occur and provide advance notice of construction activities so that you can more easily plan your commute and trail use.            6.   What construction impacts can be expected?     Nearby residents, businesses, and commuters may experience typical construction impacts, such as noise, dust, heavy equipment, and visual impacts during construction hours. In addition, areas around construction sites may have limited access for periods of time in order to ensure safety and permitting compliance. Temporary traffic impacts may also be experienced as construction crews navigate equipment and manage construction routes. \t\t\t         7.   How will construction traffic be managed?     As equipment is moved in and out of construction sites, temporary slow traffic zones and monitored traffic safety measures will be implemented. Because safety is a top priority for ACWD, it may be necessary to temporarily close portions of the street to allow for access to/from project sites. We are committed to minimizing disruptions to residents and businesses and will post information online in advance of construction activities. \t\t\t         8.   Will the Alameda Creek Trail be closed during construction?      Alameda Creek Trail provides recreation to so many in the community and we will work to limit trail closures, when possible. The safety of trail users and their pets is a priority so there may be instances when closures occur as a safety precaution.  Trail closures are not planned during the RD3 Fishway project; however; certain areas along and adjacent to the Alameda Creek Trail, such as access from Rancho Arroyo Park to the creek, may be  temporarily impacted by construction projects occurring in 2019 \u2013 2021.   Construction notices will be posted online and along recreational trails and areas to advise you of impending closures and alternative routes.  All project schedules are available at www.acwd.org/Fishway           9.   Will dogs still be allowed in Shinn Meadow?     Recreational activities at Shinn Meadow may be impacted by the construction of projects scheduled in 2019 - 2021.  A temporary gated fence to provide for an enclosed off-leash dog area will be placed around Shinn Meadow, although the area may temporarily be closed for safety. We will utilize various media to advise you of current and upcoming construction activities.            10.   Will fishing be impacted at Quarry Lakes or Shinn Pond?     The fishing pier at Quarry Lakes will be temporarily closed only during the construction of projects scheduled in 2019 - 2021 to accommodate low water levels necessary for construction activities. Where fishing is currently allowed at Shinn Pond, shore access may be temporarily restricted during construction. Construction notices will be posted near recreational areas and online. \t\t\t         11.   What is the cost of these projects and how will they be funded?    ACWD will invest a total of $40 million for the combined projects in and along Alameda Creek. These projects will allow ACWD to continue operations of rubber dams and water diversion pipelines along the creek to recharge the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner, while still providing about 40 percent of the water supply to the communities of Fremont, Newark and Union City.  These projects are funded through grants, ACWD\u2019s Capital Improvement Program, and the Alameda County Flood Control District (ACFCD). ACFCD is partially funding the Rubber Dam No. 1/Flood Control Drop Structure Fish Ladder Project. \t\t\t         12.   What are the environmental impacts of this project?    Environmental impacts associated with the fish passage improvements have been evaluated and are addressed in an Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Public comments on the MND were accepted and carefully reviewed by ACWD throughout a 30-day public comment period. As the project continues, we will monitor the lakes and creek for impacts on wildlife as outlined in the MND. Although no long-term impacts to the environment are anticipated, a biologist will be onsite to monitor the construction activities for compliance with the MND. \t\t\t         13.   Why are the creek and pond levels so low, and how will this impact fish?     Spring 2013 represents the regions driest conditions on record. As a result, water levels in Grau and Snell Ponds (at Niles Community Park) are at historic lows.  At this time, ACWD is not operating any facilities in Alameda Creek. The current low flow conditions in the creek are a result of natural conditions. During dry years like this one, it is natural to see low water levels in local streams, ponds and lakes.  ACWD understands and shares the public\u2019s concerns expressed about the fate of the fish in the ponds and creek beds as they dry due to weather conditions. The District has been in contact with local fisheries biologists and the Department of Fish and Wildlife about this issue. Because the impacted fish are an invasive, non-native species not protected by the Fish and Game Code, the fish will not be relocated.

What is AMI technology?     The Alameda County Water District (ACWD) is investing in the future of our community by installing Advanced Metering Infrastructure, more commonly known as AMI. This new technology allows water meters to be read remotely for faster leak detection, an increase in customers\u2019 ability to monitor, analyze, and compare consumption data from our user-friendly  My Smart Water Connect  web portal, and creates an overall improved customer experience.           2.   What are the benefits of AMI for me?     AMI allows water meters to be read remotely so customers can: \u2022 Detect potential leaks early \u2022 Reduce surprise water bills \u2022 View up-to-date water usage This new tool supports customers\u2019 water efficiency efforts and reduces the agency\u2019s carbon footprint with fewer trucks on the road since water meters will soon be read remotely instead of manually once every two months. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.\u00a0           3.   What does the AMI project mean for me?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024.

Why does ACWD need to upgrade my current water meter?     In order to bring you these new AMI services and capabilities, your current water meter will need to be upgraded to one that it is AMI compatible. Many of the meters we have in service now are nearing the end of their useful life and will need to be replaced in the coming years anyway. By replacing them with AMI compatible meters, we can enhance current customer service offerings and make available new and enhanced services like leak alerts, timely usage measurements and usage alerts to reduce surprise water bills.           8.   Why is ACWD doing this AMI Project now?     The implementation of AMI technology will help the District continue to improve the cost-effectiveness and value of District services. Additionally, ACWD is committed to outstanding customer service and promoting open communication with our customers, and AMI technology will further improve our ability to do just that. The District also has a long-standing commitment to stewardship of water resources and the environment, and AMI technology will also advance that tradition by further reducing the environmental impacts of our operations. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability \u00a0 for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           9.   When will my water meter be upgraded? How will I know?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. A map of the AMI deployment progress providing an estimated timeframe for when your location will be upgrade to AMI technology is located at our user-friendly  My Smart Water Connect  web portal. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is complete We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           10.   How can I prepare for my upgrade?     \u2022\u00a0 Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access. \u2022\u00a0 Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time. If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). \u00a0\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Your water service will be temporarily turned off \u2014 for no more than one hour unless otherwise communicated \u2014 for the installation of the AMI device. If you have a water-dependent device, such as a recirculation pump, you will need to turn it off before your upgrade to avoid possible damage.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 If you have tenants associated with this billing address, please notify them.           11.   I have a smart home water monitoring device attached to my water meter. What should I do? Is it the same as a new AMI meter?     A smart home water monitoring device is a great tool and can typically record water use at 1-minute intervals and be seen in real time in an app. The new AMI meter upgrade you will receive monitors use at 15-minute intervals and data is available the next day in the ACWD My Smart Water Connect customer portal and mobile app. This is the main difference between the two devices. However, as of now, some smart home water monitoring devices, such as the Flume, are not compatible with the ultra-sonic meters that ACWD is installing as part of the AMI upgrade. \u00a0You will need to remove your smart home water monitoring device prior to the AMI upgrade. You will receive a door hanger within 10 working days before the installers arrive to upgrade the meter. If you do not remove your smart home water monitoring device beforehand, ACWD\u2019s contractor will leave a door hanger indicating they cannot access the meter and request that you call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521 to let our installation partners know when the device has been removed.           12.   Will I need to do anything to sign up to receive my AMI meter upgrade?     No. You will be notified before and after the AMI meter is installed, but you don\u2019t need to sign-up to receive the new meter. However, we do ask that once you receive a letter in the mail informing you about the installation that you keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time.           13.   Can I make an appointment for the upgrade?     If you require planned water disruption, or any further assistance, please call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521. \u00a0 \u00a0            14.   After my meter was upgraded/replaced, my water was discolored. Is it still safe?     Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration. Your water remains safe and meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. Please run cold water from a fixture without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water and use it for watering plants.           15.   Have other water districts implemented AMI?     Locally, Dublin San Ramon Services District, City of Pleasanton, City of Hayward, San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and many others have adopted AMI technology in recent years. Hundreds of utility districts across North America have adopted AMI technology for their meter infrastructure needs. This technology has been approved for use in California since 2006 and has become the standard for water meter reading technology.           16.   Is there a cost associated with these AMI improvements?     There is no additional cost to customers for upgrading our meters. The AMI improvements have been fully budgeted in the District\u2019s long term financial plan. Furthermore, because meters that can be read remotely greatly reduce vehicle and other expenses, the District expects the AMI improvements to save money over the long term. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           17.   Will my information be secure?        Yes. Preserving the security of our customers\u2019 data and personal information is one of ACWD\u2019s top priorities. The AMI system will feature advanced encryption technologies that will keep your data safe.           18.   Is AMI technology safe?      Yes. As your neighbor, ACWD takes great pride in providing safe drinking water to the communities we serve. The District would never undertake a project that could be harmful to the health or privacy of the members of our community and we will do everything in our power to ensure that this project is no different.           19.   Is AMI technology a wise investment?      Yes. The District has evaluated AMI and found that the return on investment will save money for the District over time while also enhancing the value and customer service the District provides. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           20.   Will the AMI technology attach to the current manually read meter or will it be placed somewhere else on residents\u2019 property?     Many of our meters are approaching the end of life and are not AMI compatible, so we will be upgrading the meters at these locations. The AMI device will attach to the meter in the meter box and be mounted to the underside of a new lid that will be installed as part of the meter replacement project.           21.   How does the new AMI technology work, and how will the meters be read?     The AMI technology employs a device that utilizes the cellular network, just like your mobile phone and also found in televisions and wireless home phones. This technology allows meters to be read remotely giving customers daily access to their water consumption data. Not only do the AMI device\u2019s radio frequency (RF) waves fall below the level of what is recommended by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), they are also less powerful than any mobile phone. Additionally, the AMI technology inside your water meter is located outside your house, which reduces contact with the RF waves.           22.   How will we be able to recognize the AMI technology installers? Will they be wearing ACWD uniforms?     ACWD has partnered with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI has successfully installed more than 1 million integrated meters, just like the ones you will be receiving, and are highly skilled at the installation process. The PMI installation team will carry a letter for our customers that will explain their work on the new meters. The PMI and ACWD Advanced Meter logos will be on their uniforms, badges, and on their trucks. You will be able to recognize the PMI installation team, as they will wear a distinct uniform that includes a: \u00a0Neon green T-shirt with the PMI logo and the ACWD Advanced Metering logo \u00a0PMI badge displaying the ACWD Advanced Metering logo and including Their name; Photo; Issue Date; And a number to call to confirm their identity.           23.   Will ACWD be hiring installers locally?     ACWD is partnering with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc. (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI will hire up to 30 Bay Area-based installers for this project, bringing jobs to the region. Customers will recognize them because of their neon green uniforms and trucks with PMI/ACWD logos. Installers will also carry a photo ID badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project. The installers are following all federal, state, and county local, state and CDC guidelines as well as local regulations, and we ask our customers to please do the same.           24.   How long will the installation take?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time. No one\u2019s water will be shut off for more than an hour unless otherwise communicated.           25.   When will I be notified about when the installers will upgrade my meter?     You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance. You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is completed We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           26.   There is someone else that has come to check my newly upgraded or replaced AMI compatible water meter, but they are not from Badger Meter or Professional Meters Inc. (PMI). Who are they?     You may also see one of our quality control technicians during or after installation. We\u2019ve partnered with Utility Partners of America UPA) to inspect our installation and ensure it meets our standards. Like installers, the quality control technician will carry a badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project.           27.   I received a notice of a pre-existing customer leak. What does this mean? Why wasn\u2019t my meter installed?     Your AMI meter could not be installed due to a pre-existing customer plumbing leak. As it was found to be customer side, it is your responsibility to fix the leak before installation can take place. ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors adopted an Ordinance Prohibiting Wasteful Use of Water, ORDINANCE NO. 2008-01 (Ordinance) which was adopted by ACWD\u2019s Board to conserve the District\u2019s water supply and eliminate the wasteful use of water, especially critical due to the drought. Under this Ordinance leaks are required to be repaired as soon as possible. ACWD can invoke the enforcement process under this Ordinance for non-compliance with the Ordinance. Once the leak has been fixed and you are ready for installation, please call our Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521.           28.   What if my question is not answered here?

What is AMI technology?     The Alameda County Water District (ACWD) is investing in the future of our community by installing Advanced Metering Infrastructure, more commonly known as AMI. This new technology allows water meters to be read remotely for faster leak detection, an increase in customers\u2019 ability to monitor, analyze, and compare consumption data from our user-friendly  My Smart Water Connect  web portal, and creates an overall improved customer experience.           2.   What are the benefits of AMI for me?     AMI allows water meters to be read remotely so customers can: \u2022 Detect potential leaks early \u2022 Reduce surprise water bills \u2022 View up-to-date water usage This new tool supports customers\u2019 water efficiency efforts and reduces the agency\u2019s carbon footprint with fewer trucks on the road since water meters will soon be read remotely instead of manually once every two months. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.\u00a0           3.

Why does ACWD need to upgrade my current water meter?     In order to bring you these new AMI services and capabilities, your current water meter will need to be upgraded to one that it is AMI compatible. Many of the meters we have in service now are nearing the end of their useful life and will need to be replaced in the coming years anyway. By replacing them with AMI compatible meters, we can enhance current customer service offerings and make available new and enhanced services like leak alerts, timely usage measurements and usage alerts to reduce surprise water bills.           8.   Why is ACWD doing this AMI Project now?     The implementation of AMI technology will help the District continue to improve the cost-effectiveness and value of District services. Additionally, ACWD is committed to outstanding customer service and promoting open communication with our customers, and AMI technology will further improve our ability to do just that. The District also has a long-standing commitment to stewardship of water resources and the environment, and AMI technology will also advance that tradition by further reducing the environmental impacts of our operations. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability \u00a0 for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           9.

How can I prepare for my upgrade?     \u2022\u00a0 Please trim any overgrown landscaping near your water meter box to provide easy installer access. \u2022\u00a0 Please keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time. If the installer must move objects to gain access to the meter box, they are not obligated to return them to their original position(s). \u00a0\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 Your water service will be temporarily turned off \u2014 for no more than one hour unless otherwise communicated \u2014 for the installation of the AMI device. If you have a water-dependent device, such as a recirculation pump, you will need to turn it off before your upgrade to avoid possible damage.\u00a0 \u2022\u00a0 If you have tenants associated with this billing address, please notify them.           11.   I have a smart home water monitoring device attached to my water meter. What should I do? Is it the same as a new AMI meter?     A smart home water monitoring device is a great tool and can typically record water use at 1-minute intervals and be seen in real time in an app. The new AMI meter upgrade you will receive monitors use at 15-minute intervals and data is available the next day in the ACWD My Smart Water Connect customer portal and mobile app. This is the main difference between the two devices. However, as of now, some smart home water monitoring devices, such as the Flume, are not compatible with the ultra-sonic meters that ACWD is installing as part of the AMI upgrade. \u00a0You will need to remove your smart home water monitoring device prior to the AMI upgrade. You will receive a door hanger within 10 working days before the installers arrive to upgrade the meter. If you do not remove your smart home water monitoring device beforehand, ACWD\u2019s contractor will leave a door hanger indicating they cannot access the meter and request that you call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521 to let our installation partners know when the device has been removed.           12.   Will I need to do anything to sign up to receive my AMI meter upgrade?     No. You will be notified before and after the AMI meter is installed, but you don\u2019t need to sign-up to receive the new meter. However, we do ask that once you receive a letter in the mail informing you about the installation that you keep a clear path to and around the meter box, so the installers can easily access and upgrade the meter within a reasonable amount of time.           13.   Can I make an appointment for the upgrade?     If you require planned water disruption, or any further assistance, please call the Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521. \u00a0 \u00a0            14.   After my meter was upgraded/replaced, my water was discolored. Is it still safe?     Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration. Your water remains safe and meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. Please run cold water from a fixture without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water and use it for watering plants.           15.   Have other water districts implemented AMI?     Locally, Dublin San Ramon Services District, City of Pleasanton, City of Hayward, San Francisco Public Utilities Commission and many others have adopted AMI technology in recent years. Hundreds of utility districts across North America have adopted AMI technology for their meter infrastructure needs. This technology has been approved for use in California since 2006 and has become the standard for water meter reading technology.           16.   Is there a cost associated with these AMI improvements?     There is no additional cost to customers for upgrading our meters. The AMI improvements have been fully budgeted in the District\u2019s long term financial plan. Furthermore, because meters that can be read remotely greatly reduce vehicle and other expenses, the District expects the AMI improvements to save money over the long term. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           17.   Will my information be secure?        Yes. Preserving the security of our customers\u2019 data and personal information is one of ACWD\u2019s top priorities. The AMI system will feature advanced encryption technologies that will keep your data safe.           18.   Is AMI technology safe?      Yes. As your neighbor, ACWD takes great pride in providing safe drinking water to the communities we serve. The District would never undertake a project that could be harmful to the health or privacy of the members of our community and we will do everything in our power to ensure that this project is no different.           19.   Is AMI technology a wise investment?      Yes. The District has evaluated AMI and found that the return on investment will save money for the District over time while also enhancing the value and customer service the District provides. Together, through the use of this smart technology, we can work toward achieving ACWD\u2019s water conservation goals and improve water supply reliability for our community while saving money through operational efficiencies.           20.   Will the AMI technology attach to the current manually read meter or will it be placed somewhere else on residents\u2019 property?     Many of our meters are approaching the end of life and are not AMI compatible, so we will be upgrading the meters at these locations. The AMI device will attach to the meter in the meter box and be mounted to the underside of a new lid that will be installed as part of the meter replacement project.           21.   How does the new AMI technology work, and how will the meters be read?     The AMI technology employs a device that utilizes the cellular network, just like your mobile phone and also found in televisions and wireless home phones. This technology allows meters to be read remotely giving customers daily access to their water consumption data. Not only do the AMI device\u2019s radio frequency (RF) waves fall below the level of what is recommended by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), they are also less powerful than any mobile phone. Additionally, the AMI technology inside your water meter is located outside your house, which reduces contact with the RF waves.           22.   How will we be able to recognize the AMI technology installers? Will they be wearing ACWD uniforms?     ACWD has partnered with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI has successfully installed more than 1 million integrated meters, just like the ones you will be receiving, and are highly skilled at the installation process. The PMI installation team will carry a letter for our customers that will explain their work on the new meters. The PMI and ACWD Advanced Meter logos will be on their uniforms, badges, and on their trucks. You will be able to recognize the PMI installation team, as they will wear a distinct uniform that includes a: \u00a0Neon green T-shirt with the PMI logo and the ACWD Advanced Metering logo \u00a0PMI badge displaying the ACWD Advanced Metering logo and including Their name; Photo; Issue Date; And a number to call to confirm their identity.           23.   Will ACWD be hiring installers locally?     ACWD is partnering with Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc. (PMI) to install the AMI devices. PMI will hire up to 30 Bay Area-based installers for this project, bringing jobs to the region. Customers will recognize them because of their neon green uniforms and trucks with PMI/ACWD logos. Installers will also carry a photo ID badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project. The installers are following all federal, state, and county local, state and CDC guidelines as well as local regulations, and we ask our customers to please do the same.           24.   How long will the installation take?     ACWD commenced successfully upgrading AMI technology at homes and businesses in March 2021, and anticipates completing the roll out to all 86,000+ homes and businesses in May 2024. We will be communicating with our customers throughout the installation process to provide updates, especially when installation is about to begin. During the one-hour installation process, installers will need to shut off the water \u2014 one home at a time. No one\u2019s water will be shut off for more than an hour unless otherwise communicated.           25.   When will I be notified about when the installers will upgrade my meter?     You\u2019ll receive a letter at your home or business informing you about the installation a few weeks in advance. You will also receive two notifications on your doorknob about your meter installation: \u2022 First Notice:  Within 10 working days in advance of the installation \u2022 Second Notice:  Once the work is completed We may also leave a third notice on your doorknob to reschedule your installation if our installation team has trouble accessing your meter.           26.   There is someone else that has come to check my newly upgraded or replaced AMI compatible water meter, but they are not from Badger Meter or Professional Meters Inc. (PMI). Who are they?     You may also see one of our quality control technicians during or after installation. We\u2019ve partnered with Utility Partners of America UPA) to inspect our installation and ensure it meets our standards. Like installers, the quality control technician will carry a badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project.           27.   I received a notice of a pre-existing customer leak. What does this mean? Why wasn\u2019t my meter installed?     Your AMI meter could not be installed due to a pre-existing customer plumbing leak. As it was found to be customer side, it is your responsibility to fix the leak before installation can take place. ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors adopted an Ordinance Prohibiting Wasteful Use of Water, ORDINANCE NO. 2008-01 (Ordinance) which was adopted by ACWD\u2019s Board to conserve the District\u2019s water supply and eliminate the wasteful use of water, especially critical due to the drought. Under this Ordinance leaks are required to be repaired as soon as possible. ACWD can invoke the enforcement process under this Ordinance for non-compliance with the Ordinance. Once the leak has been fixed and you are ready for installation, please call our Installation Hotline: (844) 280-6521.           28.   What if my question is not answered here?     More information, including meeting details and how to take our survey, can be found at ACWD.ORG/AMI. \u00a0The AMI Project Team provided a Virtual Community Informational Meeting on November 16, 2021. \u00a0In case you weren't able to join us, but are interested in learning more:\u00a0 \u00ad\u00adHere's the link to the\u00a0 Presentation Material .

What is the purpose of the projects along Alameda Creek?     The projects along Alameda Creek will allow steelhead trout and other threatened/endangered fish species to more easily and safely migrate upstream and downstream. At the same time, they will allow us to maintain reliable water supplies for residents and businesses in Fremont, Newark, and Union City.           2.   Why is ACWD concerned about fish in Alameda Creek?     Steelhead trout are a federally listed threatened species. Modifications to the Alameda Creek streambed and urbanization of the surrounding region have eliminated spawning areas and made it impossible for steelhead to migrate upstream. As a result, steelhead trout have been absent from Alameda Creek and its tributaries for several decades. Without implementing these projects, we would have to significantly curtail our groundwater recharge operations, limiting our ability to maintain reliable water supplies from Alameda Creek. \t\t\t         3.   How will these projects improve fish passage?     Threatened steelhead trout utilize Alameda Creek to migrate to/from the ocean on a journey that is an important part of our ecosystem. ACWD is working to enhance the migration conditions for steelhead trout by installing state-of-the-art fish screens and ladders.\t\t\t         4.   Who is involved?     ACWD is part of a regional effort focused on protecting the needs of threatened/endangered fish. Other partners include the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, Zone 7 Water Agency, East Bay Regional Park District, and Alameda County Public Works Agency, ACWD\u2019s efforts to improve steelhead passage through Alameda Creek represent a critical link in the greater Bay Area and northern California restoration efforts.\t\t\t         5.   When and where will construction take place?    ACWD\u2019s ongoing commitment to environmental and wildlife protection includes the construction of several projects along Alameda Creek. These projects span several years --- several projects have been completed with projects continuing into 2021. Up-to-date project locations and schedules can be found at: www.acwd.org/Fishway.   We will strive to limit construction hours to Monday-Friday between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., but construction may also occur on Saturdays and Sundays or at night, as needed. We will post notices where construction will occur and provide advance notice of construction activities so that you can more easily plan your commute and trail use.            6.   What construction impacts can be expected?     Nearby residents, businesses, and commuters may experience typical construction impacts, such as noise, dust, heavy equipment, and visual impacts during construction hours. In addition, areas around construction sites may have limited access for periods of time in order to ensure safety and permitting compliance. Temporary traffic impacts may also be experienced as construction crews navigate equipment and manage construction routes. \t\t\t         7.   How will construction traffic be managed?     As equipment is moved in and out of construction sites, temporary slow traffic zones and monitored traffic safety measures will be implemented. Because safety is a top priority for ACWD, it may be necessary to temporarily close portions of the street to allow for access to/from project sites. We are committed to minimizing disruptions to residents and businesses and will post information online in advance of construction activities. \t\t\t         8.   Will the Alameda Creek Trail be closed during construction?      Alameda Creek Trail provides recreation to so many in the community and we will work to limit trail closures, when possible. The safety of trail users and their pets is a priority so there may be instances when closures occur as a safety precaution.  Trail closures are not planned during the RD3 Fishway project; however; certain areas along and adjacent to the Alameda Creek Trail, such as access from Rancho Arroyo Park to the creek, may be  temporarily impacted by construction projects occurring in 2019 \u2013 2021.   Construction notices will be posted online and along recreational trails and areas to advise you of impending closures and alternative routes.  All project schedules are available at www.acwd.org/Fishway           9.   Will dogs still be allowed in Shinn Meadow?     Recreational activities at Shinn Meadow may be impacted by the construction of projects scheduled in 2019 - 2021.  A temporary gated fence to provide for an enclosed off-leash dog area will be placed around Shinn Meadow, although the area may temporarily be closed for safety. We will utilize various media to advise you of current and upcoming construction activities.            10.   Will fishing be impacted at Quarry Lakes or Shinn Pond?     The fishing pier at Quarry Lakes will be temporarily closed only during the construction of projects scheduled in 2019 - 2021 to accommodate low water levels necessary for construction activities. Where fishing is currently allowed at Shinn Pond, shore access may be temporarily restricted during construction. Construction notices will be posted near recreational areas and online. \t\t\t         11.   What is the cost of these projects and how will they be funded?    ACWD will invest a total of $40 million for the combined projects in and along Alameda Creek. These projects will allow ACWD to continue operations of rubber dams and water diversion pipelines along the creek to recharge the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner, while still providing about 40 percent of the water supply to the communities of Fremont, Newark and Union City.  These projects are funded through grants, ACWD\u2019s Capital Improvement Program, and the Alameda County Flood Control District (ACFCD). ACFCD is partially funding the Rubber Dam No. 1/Flood Control Drop Structure Fish Ladder Project. \t\t\t         12.   What are the environmental impacts of this project?    Environmental impacts associated with the fish passage improvements have been evaluated and are addressed in an Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Public comments on the MND were accepted and carefully reviewed by ACWD throughout a 30-day public comment period. As the project continues, we will monitor the lakes and creek for impacts on wildlife as outlined in the MND. Although no long-term impacts to the environment are anticipated, a biologist will be onsite to monitor the construction activities for compliance with the MND. \t\t\t         13.   Why are the creek and pond levels so low, and how will this impact fish?     Spring 2013 represents the regions driest conditions on record. As a result, water levels in Grau and Snell Ponds (at Niles Community Park) are at historic lows.  At this time, ACWD is not operating any facilities in Alameda Creek. The current low flow conditions in the creek are a result of natural conditions. During dry years like this one, it is natural to see low water levels in local streams, ponds and lakes.  ACWD understands and shares the public\u2019s concerns expressed about the fate of the fish in the ponds and creek beds as they dry due to weather conditions. The District has been in contact with local fisheries biologists and the Department of Fish and Wildlife about this issue. Because the impacted fish are an invasive, non-native species not protected by the Fish and Game Code, the fish will not be relocated. Ongoing monitoring of the ponds and creek beds will continue in response to natural weather conditions.\t\t\t         14.   How can I get more information?     We are committed to notifying the public in advance of construction activities. Notices will be posted along recreational trails and areas, and construction schedules and staff contact information can be found online at www.acwd.org/Fishway. \t\t\t                   \u25bc  Bill Payment - Online Payment System Upgrade\t\t         Show All Answers       1.

Why are chloramines toxic to fish?     Chloramines are safe for humans but toxic to fish.  When chloramines, a combination of chlorine and ammonia, break down either naturally or through the use chlorine removing chemicals, ammonia is released.  The ammonia can be removed from fish tanks or ponds by using commercial products available at pet supply stores.  Biological filters, natural zeolites and pH control methods are also effective in reducing the toxic effects of ammonia.\t\t\t         2.   Are chloramines toxic to both saltwater and freshwater fish?    Yes. Chloramines affect saltwater fish in the same way they affect freshwater fish.\t\t\t         3.   Do chloramines pose a hazard to koi?    Yes. Koi are just as susceptible to chloramines as other fish.\t\t\t         4.   Will letting water sit for a few days cause chloramines to disappear?    No. Unlike chlorine, which dissipates when water sits for a few days, chloramines may take weeks to disappear. \t\t\t         5.   Do chloramines have to be removed if only a small amount of water is added to an aquarium or pond to make up for evaporation loss?    To know for sure, you'll have to monitor for total chlorine residual. Chloramine residuals in water used to keep fish should be kept below 0.1 mg/L. Total chlorine test kits are available from pet stores, pool supply stores and chemical supply houses. Make sure, however, that the kit is for \"total chlorine\" or \"combined chlorine,\" not \"free chlorine.\" A free chlorine test of chloraminated water would read zero but still be toxic to fish.\t\t\t         6.   Will a carbon filter remove chloramines?    No. Most carbon filters will not remove chloramines.\t\t\t         7.   Will reverse osmosis remove chloramines?    No. Salts can be caught by the permeable membrane but chloramines pass through easily.\t\t\t         8.   Will boiling remove chloramines from water?    No. Boiling is not an effective way to remove chloramines from water. The only practical methods of removing chloramines from water are using a water conditioner which contains a dechloraminator or by using a granular activated carbon. Ask your pet supplier for instructions on how to use these products.\t\t\t         9.   Who can I contact if I have additional questions about chloramines?    If you have questions or comments about chloramination, please contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.\t\t\t                   \u25bc  Chlorine & Chlorination Byproducts FAQs\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   Why is chlorine added to the tap water?    Chlorine disinfection is used to kill microbes that could be harmful to your health.  It is an important treatment process that ensures your tap water is safe to drink.\t\t\t         2.   What are chlorination byproducts?    Chlorination byproducts are chemical compounds formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter in water. Total trihalomethanes are a specific group of regulated compounds formed when chlorination is practiced.\t\t\t         3.   What steps has ACWD taken to ensure that chlorination byproducts are minimized?    1. Routinely controlling and monitoring water treatment processes to limit the formation of chlorination byproducts.  2. Monitoring for total trihalomethanes at representative locations throughout the distribution system as required by State and federal regulations.  3. Reviewing the latest regulations and health effects information, and employing improved treatment strategies to ensure that facilities are operated to further limit the formation of chlorination byproducts. \t\t\t         4.   Does ACWD meet current state and federal regulations for total trihalomethanes?    Yes. ACWD regularly monitors for these chlorination byproducts and meets state and federal regulations which require that the running average concentration of total trihalomethanes remain below 80 \u00b5g/L. \t\t\t                   \u25bc  Customers - Customer Service\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.           4.   What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.  The District charges fees for these and other services so the applicable party pays for these costs instead of the general District ratepayer.  While many District fees are designed to recover the full cost the activity, the new $20 field charges for door tags and shutoff are less than the District\u2019s full cost.  Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?     The Alameda County Water District has a long-term financial obligation as a member of the State Water Project and collects a portion of its state water costs on the property tax bill. The amounts collected are adjusted each year based on the District\u2019s state water costs. The State Water Project provides about 40% of the District\u2019s water supply in a typical year.                     \u25bc  Customers - Understanding Backflow\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   Can water flow backward?    Yes. Water, like electricity, takes the path of least resistance from a higher pressure to a lower pressure. Normally, water flows directly from our mains to your property, but in certain situations, such as a main break, water can flow back into the distribution system. \t\t\t                   \u25bc  Customers - Water Conservation\t\t         Show All Answers       1.

I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     To report water waste, please call ACWD Customer Service during regular business hours at (510) 668-4200. You may also use our  online reporting form .                     \u25bc  Discolored Water FAQs\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   Why is my drinking water discolored (yellow, brown, black)?    Water main breaks, firefighting activities, extremely high system demand, and the start-up or shut-down of a water treatment facility can increase the velocity at which water travels through water mains. If the water\u2019s speed becomes great enough, iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the mains may get stirred up, resulting in discolored water.           2.   Is discolored water from these activities safe to drink?     Discolored water caused by iron and manganese oxide sediment is safe to drink. During such discolored water episodes, your water continues to meet or surpass all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. ACWD cleans  its water mains  annually to remove sediment, which helps to minimize discolored water episodes. For further details regarding this program, visit the District's  Main Cleaning Program  page.           3.   What should I do if my drinking water becomes discolored?    If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears. To remove the discoloration, flush the pipes in your house using the following procedure:  1. Run the outside front hose faucet at full force for a few minutes or until the water clears. 2. If the water does not clear after a few minutes, wait another hour and repeat the process until the water is clear at the outside front hose faucet. 3.Flush the cold water faucets throughout the house. Start by flushing the cold water faucet in the bathtub. If you are concerned about wasting water, water the backyard from the backyard hose bib for several minutes or until the water clears.  4. After the tub or backyard faucet runs clear, flush all of the other cold water household faucets; starting from the front of the house (nearest the street), then the rest of the cold water faucets within the home.  5. If necessary, remove faucet aerators and clear any particles and then reinstall them. If the water still fails to clear, contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.           4.   After flushing my pipes, my cold water runs clear but my hot water is still discolored. What should I do?    If discolored water has been drawn into the hot water system, the hot water can continue to be used until the discoloration dissipates and is no longer an aesthetic issue. This is generally preferred to draining and refilling the water heater which may require expert help (calling a plumber).  \t\t\t How to flush a water heater           5.   My clothes have been stained by discolored water. What can I do to remove the stains?    You may use commonly available stain removal products that can be purchased at any supermarket. Contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500 if you need further assistance.\t\t\t                   \u25bc  Domestic Plumbing FAQs\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel.

If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   How do I disinfect a drain?    The odor of rotten eggs or sewage in the water is usually caused by sewer gases forming in the household drain. These gases are formed by bacteria which live on food, soap, hair, and other organic matter in the drain. These gases are heavier than air and remain in the drain until the water is turned on. As the water runs down the drain, the gases are expelled into the atmosphere around the sink. It is natural to associate these odors with the water because they are observed only when the water is turned on. However, the odor is not in the water, it is simply the water pushing the gas out of the drain.  Disinfecting the drain will remove the bacteria in the drain that are causing these foul odors.  Caution: do not mix any drain cleaners or detergents with bleach; certain combinations can create toxic fumes.  1. Run the cold water for about 15 seconds into the drain that is to be disinfected, then turn the water off.  2. Pour approximately one to two cups of liquid chlorine bleach (laundry bleach) down the drain. Pour the bleach slowly around the edges of the drain so that it runs down the sides of the drain. Be careful: bleach may cause eye damage, skin irritation, and may damage clothing. 3. If the odor is coming from a sink with a garbage disposal, turn the disposal on for a few seconds while the bleach is being poured. This will disperse the bleach around the inside of the disposal. Caution: take care to avoid splashing for the few seconds the disposal is turned on. Bleach may cause eye damage, skin irritation, and may damage clothing.  4. Allow the bleach to remain undisturbed in the drain for about 10 minutes. Caution: prolonged contact with metals may cause pitting and/or discoloration.  5. After 10 minutes, run hot water into the drain for a minute or two to flush out the bleach. If a garbage disposal was disinfected, thoroughly flush it as well.  6. Repeat this procedure if the odor returns.            3.   How do I heat-disinfect my water heater?    A sulfurous or rotten egg-like odor in the hot water is caused by bacteria growing in the water heater. This growth usually happens when the water heater is turned off while on vacation, when the hot water has not been used for a long time, or when the temperature setting on the heater is set too low. While the bacteria in the water heater are not a health threat, they must be eliminated to remove the odor problem. Heat disinfection is used to eliminate the bacteria. It involves draining the water heater, maximizing the temperature in the water heater, and then draining the water heater again.  If you do not feel comfortable doing this work yourself, hire a licensed plumber to do it for you.  1. Select a time to drain the water heater. We recommend an evening since this will minimize the impact your typical use of hot water. 2. Turn the thermostat on the heater off so that only the pilot light remains on. If the heater is drained while the heating flame is on, the heater may be damaged.  3. Turn off the water supply to the water heater. There may be a valve to do this right at the inlet to the water heater, or the water supply to the entire property may need to be shut off at the house valve.  4. Open one or more hot water faucets inside the house. This allows air to enter the heater as the water drains out in step 6.  5. Attach a garden hose to the draincock located at the bottom of the water heater. The draincock usually looks like a regular hose bib (garden faucet) or a round dial with a threaded hole in the middle.  6. Extend the garden hose to a place where the water can be disposed of (e.g. a drain, the driveway, etc.).  7. Open the draincock and allow all of the water to drain out of the water heater. This can take anywhere from five minutes to half an hour or more depending on the capacity of the heater and the size of the draincock. Caution: the draining water will be very hot. Also note that if the draincock is made of plastic and the water heater is several years old, it may be difficult to open and may break easily if forced.  8. When the water heater is empty, close the draincock and remove the garden hose.  9. Turn the water supply to the water heater back on. Leave the hot water faucet(s) inside the house turned on. This will allow the air in the water heater to escape as it refills with water. There will likely be \"hissing\" sounds and/or \"spitting and sputtering\" as air and water begin coming out of the hot water faucets. When the water flow from the faucet(s) returns to normal, shut them off.  10. That night (before going to bed), turn the thermostat for the water heater to its highest temperature setting for one night. Caution: make sure everyone who uses the water is aware that the hot water is going to be hotter than usual.  11. The next morning, turn the thermostat on the heater off so that only the pilot light remains on. If the heater is drained while the heating flame is on, the heater may be damaged.  12. Drain and refill the water heater by repeating steps 2 through 8.  13. Return the thermostat on the water heater to the normal setting (usually around 130\u00b0F).            4.   How do I flush a water heater?    Water heaters should be flushed at least once a year - twice a year is even better - to control the build-up of mineral deposits. The water heater will operate more fuel efficiently and will last longer.  The water heater will also need to be flushed if the hot water becomes yellow or brown due to an accumulation of rust or if you find sand-like mineral sediment in the hot water.  If you do not feel comfortable doing this work yourself, hire a licensed plumber to do it for you. 1. Do not shut off the gas or the water supply to the heater.  2. Attach a garden hose to the draincock located at the bottom of the heater. The draincock usually looks like a regular hose bib (garden faucet) or a round dial with a threaded hole in the middle.  3. Extend the garden hose to a place where the water can safely exit the heater (e.g. a drain, a driveway, etc.).  4. Open the draincock to allow the water to exit the heater. Caution: the water leaving the heater will be hot and under normal household water pressure. Also note that if the draincock is made of plastic and the heater is several years old, it may be difficult to open and may break easily if forced.  5. After five minutes of flushing, fill a bucket with the still flushing water.  6. Allow the water in the bucket to stand undisturbed for a minute and see if the water has cleared or if any sand-like material settles to the bottom. If the water has cleared and no sand-like material is observed, go on to step 7. If the water is discolored and/or sand-like material is observed at the bottom of the bucket, repeat steps 5 and 6 until the water is completely clear and free of sediment.  7. Close the draincock and remove the garden hose.            5.   I have a leak at my meter. Who is responsible for this repair, me or ACWD?    ACWD is responsible for the materials and water quality up to and including the customers\u2019 water meter.  The customer is responsible for the materials on their side of the meter including the service line and all of the building\u2019s internal plumbing. How do I contact ACWD if I have a question about or a problem with my drinking water?  You can call us at (510) 668-6500.           6.   Who can I contact if I have additional questions?

Does ACWD have enough water?     Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years. More significantly, these recent dry years exhibit characteristics of changed precipitation patterns that are anticipated to occur with climate change \u2013 notably a shorter rainy season and a longer dry season. ACWD is working with water resources managers throughout the state to study and prepare for climate change and develop adaption plans for the new weather patterns; the challenges of today\u2019s drought form a learning opportunity for better management tomorrow \u2013 a silver lining!           3.   How do I take care of my trees?     After several critically dry years, it is important to conserve now to save water for the future. However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0           4.

Each one of us can make a difference \u2013 working together as one community to make conservation a way of life in California. \u00a0 \u00a0           5.   How long will the water shortage emergency last and restrictions remain in place?     ACWD's water shortage emergency has been lifted and water use restrictions are no longer in effect.           6.   What is best practice for irrigating my lawn?      ACWD prohibits irrigation runoff so we recommend using a cycle and soak method when irrigating to avoid runoff. A cycle and soak method uses shorter, more frequent cycles of irrigation in one day versus one long runtime. To determine the time you should water for a cycle and soak method, run your irrigation system until you start to see signs of runoff (e.g. water overflowing from landscape onto sidewalk). Then, turn off your irrigation and let the landscape soak for 1 hour and repeat the process 2-3 times. Note the time it takes to begin seeing runoff \u2013 anything applied beyond this time during a single watering event is wasted.\u00a0           7.   I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     If you witness water waste, you can report it to ACWD by completing our Water Waste Reporting Form at  acwd.org/reportwaste  or by calling our Water Use Efficiency team at 510.668.4218. For water emergencies, such as a broken main or fire hydrant, please contact our 24-hour emergency hotline at 510.668.6500.           8.   What is the ban on non-functional turf for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers passed by the State of California?     On June 10, 2022, the State of California\u2019s emergency regulation for urban water conservation prohibiting irrigation of non-functional turf at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties went into effect and was readopted for another year on June 5, 2023. This regulation also prohibits irrigation of non-functional turf in common areas of Homeowners Associations (HOAs). It does not apply to residential properties. Check out the  non-functional turf fact sheet  or visit the  State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information, including a list of  frequently asked questions.  Become future-ready and remove grass and non-functional turf now by taking advantage of ACWD\u2019s Lawn Be Gone Rebate Program.  Learn more.           9.   What is \"non-functional\" turf?     The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?     For an extensive list of water efficient tips and techniques for different types of landscape, check out  ACWD\u2019s Survival Tips for Your Landscape resource . See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule. For more questions regarding the rate and fee schedule, contact customer service at (510) 668 \u2013 4200.\u00a0 You can also\u00a0 review the document here.                     \u25bc  Facility Tour FAQS\t\t         Show All Answers       1.

Does ACWD fluoridate its water?     Yes, voters required\u00a0the addition of fluoride in the early 1970\u2019s and ACWD began fluoridating drinking water in 1976.           2.   Why do you fluoridate the drinking water?    Fluoride is added to your drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. Although fluoride is found naturally in almost all water sources, it is generally not enough to provide oral health benefits. Drinking fluoridated water benefits the whole community, including people of all ages and especially low-income and underserved populations. \t\t\t         3.   What is fluoride?    Fluoride is a naturally-occurring element found in rocks and soil. As water passes through and over soil and rock formations containing fluoride, the fluoride dissolves into the water.\t\t\t         4.   How much fluoride is added to my water?    ACWD supplements the naturally-occurring fluoride in your drinking water to meet the California State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Drinking Water (DDW) recommended optimal level of 0.7 parts per million (ppm). Samples are collected daily to ensure that the fluoride level is within the State-specified control range of 0.6-1.2 ppm.\t\t\t         5.   How does ACWD monitor the fluoride level in my water?    ACWD uses continuous monitoring equipment at each of its treatment facilities. Water samples are also collected and analyzed daily from 53 locations throughout the service area. Compliance reports are submitted monthly to the DDW, the Alameda County Public Health Department, and the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency. \t\t\t         6.   What do health professionals say about fluoride?    Medical and dental experts endorse water fluoridation as the single most effective public health measure to improve oral health. For over 65 years, drinking fluoridated water has been scientifically proven to be safe and effective.  Local, state, and national health organizations emphasize the benefits of fluoridation for community prevention of tooth decay and maintain that fluoride poses no health threat. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention proclaimed fluoridation to be one of the top ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.           7.   What are the regulations on fluoridating drinking water?    Assembly Bill 733, signed into law in 1995, requires large water systems to fluoridate their public water supplies. It also directs DDW to seek funding for fluoridation. In April 1998, DDW adopted regulations to enforce the water fluoridation requirements in AB 733.  Senate Bill 96, passed in 2004, further reinforced community water fluoridation as a statewide public health priority and preempted local regulations.            8.   Do statewide regulations regarding fluoridation apply to ACWD?    Yes, statewide regulations apply to large water systems with at least 10,000 service connections and require that:  Large systems with existing fluoridation practices continue fluoridating, and  Large non-fluoridated systems start fluoridating when funding is made available  ACWD delivers water to over 80,000 service connections and is required to fluoridate in order to stay compliant.           9.   Should I use fluoride supplements?    Drinking fluoridated water on a regular basis makes the use of fluoride supplements unnecessary. Simultaneous use of fluoride supplements and drinking fluoridated water is not recommended by health professionals. Contact your health care or dental care provider if you have questions about fluoride supplements. \t\t\t         10.   Is fluoride okay for my pets?    Fluoride in levels administered for drinking water is safe for humans and all animals. Fluoridated water has no effect on the growth of tropical fish or goldfish. Research and experience have shown that fluoridation at optimal levels does not harm people or the environment. \t\t\t         11.   If I have water filter, is it removing the fluoride?    To find out if fluoride is being removed, check with the filter manufacturer. Typically, carafe filters, faucet filters, and carbon filters do not remove fluoride.\t\t\t         12.   If I do not want to drink fluoridated tap water, how can I remove the fluoride?    There are four different ways to remove fluoride from tap water: activated alumina filters, distillation, reverse osmosis, and anion exchange. No treatment method will remove all of the fluoride. Consult with the manufacturers on the amount of fluoride their products can remove.  The most effective whole house filtration method for removing fluoride is reverse osmosis which has up to 80-90% efficiency. Water distillation systems remove up to 100% of fluoride, and bottled water does not generally contain fluoride.  The following products or procedures will NOT remove fluoride:  - Activated carbon filters - Water softeners - Boiling water - concentrates fluoride rather than reduces it.  - Refrigerating or freezing water - has no effect on the concentration of fluoride in the water            13.   Which organizations endorse water fluoridation?    The following organizations endorse fluoridation as an important public health measure for reducing tooth decay:  - The American Dental Association  - The American Medical Association  - The American Water Works Association - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - California Department of Public Health - Alameda County Public Health Department \t\t\t                   \u25bc  Lead Information\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   What is lead?    Lead is a metal found in natural deposits and can be found in all parts of our environment, indoors and out. Lead was commonly used in older household plumbing materials until 1986 when the plumbing rules changed and required pipes, fittings and fixtures to be \u201clead-free.\u201d  The most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach lead into the water, especially hot water. \t\t\t         2.   How does it get into drinking water?    Lead can get into drinking water when service lines, household pipes, or household fixtures corrode, but ACWD is fortunate in that we do not have lead service lines and our source water does not contain lead.  Our corrosion control program, described below, helps to limit leaching of lead by preventing the corrosion of household pipes and fixtures.\t\t\t         3.   What is ACWD doing to keep lead out of my water?    Since the 1990s ACWD has been proactively monitoring and adjusting the water quality, specifically pH, at our treatment plants daily so the water is not corrosive to household pipes and plumbing fixtures. In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t\t         4.   How do I know ACWD's Corrosion Control Program is working?    The results of our 2015 testing demonstrates that our Corrosion Control Program is effective.  Every three years we work with at least 50 homeowners to collect a water sample from inside their homes. These samples are considered to be worst-case scenario because they are collected after the water has been still for at least 6 hours (so the water is in contact with the household plumbing for a long time), and the home\u2019s plumbing was in place before the 1986 lead ban (so the plumbing is more likely to have lead). These samples are analyzed by our State-certified laboratory and results are reported to the California Division of Drinking Water, our Board of Directors, the public, and most importantly the homeowners who collected samples.  As part of our compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, these results are compared to the Action Level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). ACWD is in compliance with the Lead Action Level because 90% or more of our samples are below the 15 ppb Action Level. In 2015, 90% of our samples were 8.1 ppb of lead or less. \t\t\t         5.   What can I do to keep lead out of my water?    Even with an effective Corrosion Control Program in place, customers may choose to take steps on their own to further minimize the potential for lead in drinking water, including:  - Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing  baby formula.  - Run the water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby formula. This water is great to use for watering plants! - Consider using a certified water filter to remove lead. Be sure to check that it is certified for lead removal. - Replace old plumbing or fixtures that may have lead. Lead pipes will have a dull gray look and can easily be scratched by a key.\t\t\t         6.   Can you test my water for me?     ACWD does not test customer's water for lead on a regular basis. However, select homes are tested for our Lead and Copper Rule compliance every three years. Although testing has concluded for 2018, we will be testing again in 2021. You can have your water tested by any state-certified lab. ACWD provides as a courtesy to its customers a list of local state-certified commercial laboratories. Please click the link below to be taken directly to the list.   Local State-Certified Commercial Lab Services           7.   Where can I learn more about lead in drinking water?    1) American Water Works Association information on lead in drinking water:          http://www.drinktap.org/water-info/whats-in-my-water/lead-in-water.aspx 2) Center for Disease Control information about lead in drinking water:            http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/tips/water.htm 3) US Environmental Protection Agency information about lead:           http://www.epa.gov/lead 4) American Academy of Pediatrics information about children and lead in drinking water:           https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Lead-in-Tap-         Water-Household-Plumbing.aspx\t\t\t                   \u25bc  Main\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   Where can I find the answers to my frequently asked questions?    Use the  FAQs module  to easily find answers to the questions you ask the most.\t\t\t         2.   Is my tap water safe to drink?     We are proud to share that your water meets or surpasses all State and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. These standards were set by the California Department of Public Health and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Your drinking water contains no herbicides, pesticides, industrial solvents or bacterial pathogens.           3.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to \t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page                     \u25bc  Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Project (MRSUP)\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   What is the purpose of the Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Program?     The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program is part of the Alameda County Water District\u2019s (District) commitment to delivering reliable drinking water supplies to more than 356,000 people living and working in Fremont, Newark and Union City. The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program will help improve water supply reliability for ACWD customers in the event of a major earthquake and will reduce service interruptions due to aging pipelines. Generally, pipelines have a lifespan of about 75 years, but the risk of a pipeline\u2019s failure increases in proportion with its age. With twenty percent of the District\u2019s pipelines installed before 1960, and the oldest pipelines placed underground in the 1940s, this project represents a major infrastructure improvement for more than 84,000 customers who depend upon reliable water supplies. Proactive pipeline upgrades protect the District and its customers from expensive fixes caused by leaks in the system.           2.   How can I stay up to date on the construction schedule?     The District is prioritizing construction sites in order of risk and project complexity within the overall program budget. Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.           3.   Why are the construction projects spread over multiple years?     All of ACWD\u2019s construction activities must comply with specific permit requirements and must take into account weather conditions and safety precautions. The staggered nature of the construction helps the District maintain reasonable working hours and reduce inconveniences to the public associated with very early and very late construction working hours.           4.   Who is paying for these projects?     The residents and businesses of Fremont, Newark, and Union City who, as ratepayers, contribute to these projects. We want to ensure our customers are aware of how their rate dollars are being used to improve water supply reliability and protect public health and safety. The costs for these projects are being funded in two ways: \u2022 Project costs have been factored into existing rate structures. \u2022 In 2012 ACWD successfully issued $45.2 million in Water Revenue Bonds to restructure existing debt at reduced interest rates and to help finance critical capital projects. By doing so, we are able to make investments in infrastructure while leveraging the District\u2019s excellent AAA bond rating and take advantage of historic low interest rates.           5.   How are you managing construction traffic?      The District is requiring its contractors to ensure that construction traffic is managed effectively and that truck traffic follows posted speed limits. We will have inspectors evaluating the project sites to ensure that rules are enforced and will address any issues that arise.           6.   How will you ensure safety at project sites during construction?     The District will ensure its contractors take precautions to ensure safety during construction, including installing barriers along construction routes, restricting travel speeds and implementing construction safety monitoring during all work. The District will provide project oversight and review during every stage of construction to ensure safety and design requirements are met, including the avoidance of gas lines and other pipelines. In the event of an emergency, the District will implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of surrounding residents, businesses and construction crews.           7.   Will the quality of the water delivered to my home be affected?     The District is committed to monitoring and ensuring water quality standards at all times. During construction, water pipelines may need to be temporarily isolated to accommodate improvements. This action may cause reverse flows in the pipeline, causing iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the pipeline to be stirred up, resulting in discolored water. However, water will remain safe to drink and continue to meet all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears. Please visit ACWD\u2019s website at www.acwd.org to learn how to flush the pipes in your home to remove the discoloration.                     \u25bc  PFAS FAQs\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   What are PFAS?  Per \u2013 and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS)     PFAS are manmade compounds that have been used to make carpets, clothing, fabrics for furniture, paper packaging for food, electronics, personal hygiene products, and other materials (e.g., cookware) designed to be waterproof, stain-resistant, or non-stick. Of particular interest are four compounds that have notification levels. Perfluorooctanoic Acid, more commonly referred to as PFOA, Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid, or PFOS, Perfluorobutane Sulfonic Acid or PFBS, and Perfluorohexanesulfonic Acid or PFHxS. In recent years people have become more familiar with the term PFAS. Although awareness of these manmade chemical compounds is recent, PFAS have been in wide use since the 1940s. Used in many consumer and industrial products for their ability to repel stains, water, and oil, PFAS are persistent in the environment and do not readily degrade. \u00a0They also are prevalent in many items we encounter daily \u2013 inside and outside the home. While items imported from outside the United States may contain PFAS, its use is being phased out in the US. \u00a0           2.   What are the sources of PFAS?     PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, and PFHxS are man-made compounds that have been used to make carpets, clothing, fabrics for furniture, paper packaging for food, electronics, personal hygiene products, and other materials (e.g., cookware) designed to be waterproof, stain-resistant, or non-stick. PFOA and PFOS were also used for firefighting at airfields and in several industrial processes. PFBS has been identified in the environment and consumer products, including surface water, dust, carpeting and carpet cleaners, floor wax, and food packaging. PFAS are persistent in the environment and do not breakdown easily.            3.   What are the health effects from PFAS?     According to the US EPA, there is evidence that exposure to PFAS can lead to adverse health outcomes in humans. If humans, or animals, ingest PFAS (by eating or drinking food or water than contain PFAS), the PFAS are absorbed, and can accumulate in the body. PFAS stay in the human body for long periods of time. As a result, as people get exposed to PFAS from different sources over time, the level of PFAS in their bodies may increase to the point where they suffer from adverse health effects. Studies indicate that PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, and PFHxS can cause reproductive and developmental, liver and kidney, and immunological effects, and decreased thyroid hormone levels in laboratory animals.\u00a0 The most consistent findings from human epidemiology studies are increased cholesterol levels among exposed populations, with more limited findings related to: infant birth weights, effects on the immune system, cancer (for PFOA), and thyroid hormone disruption (for PFOS and PFBS). effects on kidneys (PFBS) growth and development in fetuses, infants, and young children (PFHxS)           4.   What are California monitoring regulations on PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, and PFHxS?      In August 2019, the Division of Drinking Water (DDW) set the customer Notification Level of 5.1 parts per trillion (ppt) for PFOA and 6.5 ppt for PFOS and in February 2020, set new a Response Level of 10 ppt for PFOA and 40 ppt for PFOS. In March 2021, DDW issued the notification level and response level for PFBS of 500 ppt and 5000 ppt, respectively. \u00a0In October 2022, DDW issued the notification level and response level for PFHxS at 3 ppt and 20 ppt, respectively. A notification level is a nonregulatory, precautionary health-based measure for concentrations of chemicals in drinking water that warrant notification and further monitoring and assessment. A response level is a nonregulatory, precautionary health-based measure that is set higher than a notification level and represents a recommended level that water systems consider taking a water source out of service or provide treatment if available to them. In March 2019, the California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) began a state-wide  PFAS investigation  and issued orders to approximately 200 water utilities throughout California to test groundwater wells that are in close proximity to fire training/fire response sites (e.g., airfields), industrial sites, landfills, and/or wastewater treatment plants for PFAS. Since ACWD groundwater sources are not located in close proximity to potential sources of contamination, ACWD was  not issued\u00a0 orders \u00a0 to monitor for PFOA, PFOS, or PFBS by  DDW . \u00a0 Assembly Bill 756 that took effect on January 1, 2020, authorized the State Board to more broadly order water systems to monitor for PFAS and report their detections. ACWD was not issued an order under the Assembly Bill. In October 2022, DDW issued monitoring orders to numerous water agencies, including ACWD, to monitor all groundwater sources effective January 1, 2023. \u00a0The provisions of the Order are similar to the voluntary monitoring program that ACWD began in June 2020. \u00a0ACWD will continue to monitor sources on a quarterly basis.           5.   Has ACWD tested its water for PFOA, PFOS, PFBS, or PFHxS?     ACWD tested drinking water supplies for PFOA and PFOS compounds in 2014, as required by the United States Environmental Protection Agency under the third Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule. ACWD did not detect PFOA or PFOS in the drinking water in 2014. Since 2014, advances in testing technologies since 2014 have allowed us to detect substances at increasingly low levels. Therefore, ACWD, once again, in June 2020, voluntarily sampled several water supply sources ahead of any regulatory requirement. \u00a0This proactive monitoring allows ACWD to ensure the best water quality is available to our customers and take measures to treat our source supplies. Our voluntary testing identified low levels of PFOA in our groundwater sources between non-detect and 6.4 ppt, with some sources above the customer notification level of 5.1 ppt. \u00a0 However, all treated water delivered to customers had no detections of PFOA. PFOS was detected in most groundwater sources at low levels, between non-detect and 15 ppt, with some sources above the customer notification level of 6.5 ppt set by the State Board. \u00a0 However, all treated water delivered to customers was below the notification level or non-detectable. PFBS was detected in some groundwater sources at low levels, between non-detect and 7.4 ppt,  with all sources below the customer notification level of 500 ppt. \u00a0All treated water delivered to customers had no detections of PFBS. PFHxS was detected in most groundwater sources, between non-detect and 14 ppt, with most of the sources above the customer notification level of 3 ppt.  Since the establishment of the notification level, ACWD has optimized operations to ensure all treated water delivered to customers remain below notification levels. Results from this same monitoring program did not detect PFOA, PFOS, or PFBS in surface water supplies which account for almost two-thirds of ACWD\u2019s total water delivered to our customers.           6.   How were tests conducted?      Samples were collected by trained sampling staff from locations where other regulatory water quality samples are collected and analyzed by a State Certified Laboratory.           7.   How often will ACWD monitor for PFAS?       As per the State Board Monitoring Order that was issued in October 2022 and is effective January 1, 2023, ACWD will continue the quarterly groundwater monitoring as it has been doing voluntarily since June 2020.           8.   What is ACWD doing about treatment for PFAS?       ACWD has existing water treatment facilities in place to effectively safeguard your water supply with the use of reverse osmosis technology at our Newark Desalination Facility and the blending of groundwater and surface water at our Blending Facility. Both these methods are already implemented at our treatment facilities and have managed to keep the detections below the notification levels, thereby ensuring the treated water supplied to our customers meets all health-based standards.\u00a0 Federal and State MCLs are expected for select PFAS compounds in 2023 and 2025, respectively. \u00a0In anticipation of MCL establishments, ACWD is designing and building a treatment facility to address PFAS in groundwater at our Blending Facility. \u00a0Currently in design, the facility will treat up to 6 million gallons per day (MGD) of PFAS-impacted groundwater and may be potentially expanded to treat up to 15 MGD in the future, if needed. \u00a0In addition, the facility will restore reduced capacity that resulted from operational changes needed to minimize PFAS levels in the treated water delivered to customers.           9.   How will customers be updated about future testing results?      ACWD will post PFAS sampling results on its website and additionally provide the sample results to the State Water Resources Control Board Division of Drinking Water who will also post it on their website. The latest data is available at  acwd.org/PFAS           10.   Where can I find more information?      More information on PFOA, PFOS, and PFBS is available at  https://www.epa.gov/pfas  or the California Water Board Frequently Asked Questions  https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/pfas/docs/pfas_general_faq.pdf                     \u25bc  Public Health Goals FAQs\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   What is a Public Health Goal (PHG)?     A PHG is the level of a chemical contaminant in drinking water that does not pose a significant risk to health. \u00a0PHGs are not regulatory standards. \u00a0However, state law requires the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to set drinking water standards for chemical contaminants as close to the corresponding PHG as is economically and technologically feasible. \u00a0In some cases, it may not be feasible for SWRCB to set drinking water standard for a contaminant at the same level as the PHG. \u00a0The technology to treat the chemicals may not be available, or the cost of treatment may be very high. \u00a0SWRCB must consider these factors when developing a drinking water standard. For more information,  view OEHHA's website           2.   What is a Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG)?     Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) is the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. \u00a0MCLGs allow for a margin of safety and are non-enforceable public health goals. For more information,  view EPA's website           3.   What is a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)?     Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) is the highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to MCLGs as feasible using the best available treatment technology and taking cost into consideration. \u00a0MCLs are enforceable standards. For more information,  view EPAs website                     \u25bc  Water for Emergencies\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How much water should I store?     Store at least two gallons of water per person per day, and prepare for a minimum of 3 to 7 days.  For a family of four, this is at least 24 to 56 gallons.  If you have any pets, be sure to store water for them too.  \t\t\t         2.   Is bottled water from the grocery store suitable for storing?     Yes. Bottled water you buy at the grocery store in sealed containers can typically be stored for several years. The bottles should be kept in a cool dark place and should not be exposed to direct sunlight or fumes from petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. You should check the bottles periodically to be sure the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. Replace the bottled water when it reaches the expiration or \u201cuse by\u201d date or if you think the bottles have leaked or lost water due to evaporation.\t\t\t         3.   More Water For Emergencies FAQs    .\t\t\t         4.   Is it safe to store tap water for use during emergencies?     ACWD tap water can be stored safety as long as you take the proper steps to sterilize the storage containers and treat the water before putting it in storage.\t\t\t         5.   What type of container should I use to store the water?     Any clean, airtight container will work, but sturdy, opaque plastic bottles with screw-on caps are preferable. Avoid glass containers that will break easily or paper containers (such as milk cartons) that will weaken over time. Make sure the container has been cleaned with hot, soapy water and rinsed well before filling.\t\t\t         6.   How do I treat the tap water I am planning to store?     Follow the steps below to properly treat the tap water you are storing for emergency use. 1.  Flush the tap for one minute.  This will ensure that any residual metals have been flushed from the home plumbing and that you are getting chlorinated water from the main.   2.  Add \u00bc teaspoon (8 drops) of chlorine bleach for each gallon the container holds. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous. 3.  Fill the container with tap water leaving as little headspace as possible. 4.  Cap the container and tape the lid to keep out dust and dirt. 5.  Place the container in a black garbage bag and close.  This controls dust and prevents algal growth. 6.  Mark the date you filled the bottle on a piece of tape and attach it to the bag. This will allow you to know when it's time to change the water you have stored. The filled water containers should be stored in a cool, dark place and should not be exposed to sunlight or fumes of petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. Remember to check the containers periodically to ensure that the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. If the containers have cracked or are leaking, replace them.            7.   How often should I change my stored water?     To ensure freshness, your emergency drinking water supply should be changed every six months if you are using tap water.\t\t\t         8.   I've used up my emergency water supply. Now what?     Several other sources of drinking water exist in your home. They include:  \u2022   Water drained from your water heater.  \u2022   Water from the flush tank, not bowl, of your toilet. Purify this water before using it.  Do not use chemically treated or \u201cblue\u201d water. \u2022   Melted ice cubes. \u2022   Liquids from canned fruits and vegetables.           9.   ACWD has issued a \"boil water notice.\" What does this mean?    During an emergency, such as a major earthquake, ACWD may issue a \"boil water notice\" until we can verify that the drinking water in our system is not contaminated and is safe to drink. Boiling water before use kills bacteria and other organisms that may be present as a result of damage to ACWD\u2019s water distribution system. During a \"boil water notice,\" any tap water used for drinking or food preparation must be boiled at a full rolling boil for at least one full minute. A full rolling boil is a vigorous boil that cannot be stopped by stirring the water. If the water is very discolored and/or has visible particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before boiling.           10.   Can I purify my water with household bleach?       Boiling water is the preferred method to kill any potential bacteria and other organisms in the water.  However, if the emergency has left you with no way to boil the water or if you have limited fuel and do not want to use it for boiling water, you may treat the water with fresh liquid chlorine laundry bleach. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous.  Also, be aware that liquid bleach loses strength with age. If the water is very dirty looking and/or has particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before treating it. Below is a description of how much liquid bleach to add to each gallon of water: \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to clear water:1/4 teaspoon (8 drops) per gallon \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to cloudy/dirty water:1/2 teaspoon (16 drops) per gallon After you add the bleach, thoroughly mix by stirring or shaking the container. Let the water stand for 30 minutes before using. A slight chlorine odor should be noticeable in the water. If not, add another dosage of bleach and allow the water to stand another 15 minutes before using. The water can also be treated with the use of water purification tablets which can be purchased at most outdoors or sporting goods stores. Follow the directions for use on the package you purchase. Treat only enough water to meet your needs for 48 hours at a time. There is an increased chance of re-contamination if the treated water sits for more than 48 hours. Refrigeration will also help avoid re-contamination. Note: Most home water filters are meant for water that is already micro-biologically safe. Using these filters during a \"boil water notice\" will not guarantee the safety of the water. Replace any filter cartridges after the boil water notice has been lifted to insure your filter is not contaminated.\t\t\t         11.   Are there any other important drinking water guidelines I should follow after a major earthquake?    It's always best to play it safe when it comes to your drinking water following a disaster. Please keep the following \"water-wise\" tips in mind when considering your source and supply of emergency drinking water.   \u2022   Even if you haven't received word of a \"boil water notice\" after a disaster, if your tap water seems cloudy or has an unpleasant odor, purify it before drinking or do not drink it at all.   \u2022   Conserve your drinking water, even if your supply is not interrupted.  Help by shutting off automatic sprinkler systems. \u2022   If plumbing fixtures in your house are damaged and/or leaking, turn off the water supply to your house at the main shut-off valve.  This valve is typically located in a meter box near the sidewalk/street. \u2022   Immediately after a major disaster, consider closing the main household water shut-off valve to isolate your water supply.  This could prevent contamination of internal plumbing and your water heater.   \u2022   If your water service is interrupted, shut off automatic sprinkler systems and turn off the water heater.\t\t\t                   \u25bc  Water Hardness FAQs\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   What is the difference between hard and soft water?    Put quite simply, hard water has more minerals in it than soft water. Calcium carbonate is the mineral most commonly associated with water hardness. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold by your local drug or health food store. Hard water reduces the \u201csudsing\u201d ability of soap and causes the spots on your dishes and glasses after washing and air-drying.  \t\t\t         2.   What is the white residue I find at the bottom of my pots and tea kettle, and around my faucet fixtures? What can I do to get rid of it?    The white residue is calcium carbonate. There are cleaning products on the market made specifically for its removal. A \u201cgreen\u201d alternative for removing hardness residue is warm vinegar. Add \u00bd cup of white distilled vinegar to the tea kettle or pot, fill with water, and let sit overnight. Persistent residue can be removed by warming vinegar in the kettle or pot, cooling, and rinsing well afterwards.\t\t\t More information about removing calcium carbonate           3.   Is calcium carbonate bad for me?    No, calcium carbonate is an essential nutrient that is used by your body to fortify bones and teeth. It also helps your muscles to function properly.\t\t\t         4.   What is my water hardness in grains/gallon?    In most cases, water quality parameters are reported in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L).  To convert hardness in ppm (or mg/L) to grains per gallon (gpg), simply divide by 17.1.  For example, water hardness of 100 ppm equals 100/17.1 or 5.85 gpg.\t\t\t                   \u25bc  WaterClips\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   Where do I submit my video?

Local supplies include fresh groundwater from the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin (underlying the District service area), desalinated brackish groundwater from portions of the groundwater basin previously impacted by seawater intrusion, and surface water from the Del Valle Reservoir. The primary source of recharge for the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin is from percolation of runoff from the Alameda Creek watershed. To a lesser degree, a portion of ACWD's SWP supplies are also used for local groundwater percolation. Infiltration of rainfall and applied water also contribute to local groundwater recharge. Water Supply Planning The District develops comprehensive, long-term planning documents to manage our water supply and ensure we meet current and future demands. Integrated Resources Plan (PDF) Urban Water Management Plan Water Supply Reliability Fact Sheet (PDF) Regional Water Supply Efforts The Bay Area Regional Reliability (BARR) Partners include the following: Alameda County Water District Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency Contra Costa Water District East Bay Municipal Utility District Marin Municipal Water District San Francisco Public Utilities Commission Santa Clara Valley Water District Zone 7 Water Agency. The BARR Partners have joined forces to leverage existing facilities and, if needed, build new ones to bolster regional water supply reliability. BARR website Treatment Before being supplied to ACWD's customers, the source water supplies are treated to meet and surpass all state and federal drinking water standards. ACWD operates one surface water treatment plant that treats SWP and local surface water from Del Valle Reservoir.
