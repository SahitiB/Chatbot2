If you would rather speak to a District representative, please call (510) 668-6500. You can also use the District's  Report a Water Quality Issue  form to request assistance. Please be aware that a response will be provided the following business day. As a reminder : District employees are experienced water professionals, not medically trained staff. If you are experiencing any symptoms of illness, the District recommends that you contact your personal physician. Basic Understandings Below are basic considerations that will help you with troubleshooting a water quality issue. Does the problem occur at some or all inside taps? Do you observe the same conditions at the outside front faucet (hose bib)? Does it occur with just the cold water, the hot water, or both? Does it occur only when you first turn on the water or does it occur continuously? When did you first notice the issue? Are your neighbors experiencing the same issue? Do you know what type of pipes you have (i.e., copper, galvanized iron)? Do you have any in-home water treatment devices (i.e., water softener, reverse osmosis system, whole house filtration system, point-of-use activated carbon filter)? If not in use, is it still connected to your internal plumbing? Index                              Color or Appearance of Water Cloudy, Foamy, or Milky Water Brown or Yellow Hot Water On First Draw Brown or Yellow Cold Water Constantly Blue Color Green Color Purging Discolored Water Floating Particles Black Particles Brown or Orange Particles White Particles Crystals or White Residue                  Taste Odor Chemical / Medicinal Odor Chlorine Odor Foul / Sulfur / Rotten Egg / Sewage Odor Swampy / Fishy / Earthy / Musty / Moldy / Grassy Odor Gasoline, Turpentine, or Organic Solvent Odor                        Color or Appearance of Water Cloudy, Foamy, or Milky Water If you are constantly experiencing cloudiness in both the cold and hot water, the cloudiness is caused by tiny air bubbles. This air is under pressure in your water pipes, much like carbon dioxide in a bottle of soda. When you turn on your tap, the pressure is released, allowing the bubbles to appear, just as removing the cap from a soda bottle causes the soda to fizz. If you allow a glass of water to stand for a few moments, the air bubbles will rise to the surface. This phenomenon is called entrained air and does not affect the quality of your water. The water is perfectly safe to drink. ( Return to top )  Brown or Yellow Hot Water On First Draw The internal plumbing of your house is the likely culprit if discolored water appears only for a minute or two after you turn on the tap. Many houses have galvanized iron pipe, and when the zinc coating on the inside of galvanized iron pipe wears thin, the water becomes discolored as it comes in contact with bare iron. The longer the water sits in the pipes, the worse the discoloration will be. That is why this problem is most noticeable the first time you turn on the tap in the morning. If only a few taps are affected, only a portion of your internal plumbing has galvanized pipe. After running your tap for a few minutes, clean water from your water heater or the water main will replace the discolored water. Since iron is an essential nutrient, this condition poses no health hazard. If the discoloration bothers you, however, flush the tap until the water becomes clear and save the water for iron-loving plants. ( Return to top )  Brown or Yellow Cold Water Constantly Light yellow to dark brown water is typically caused by a disturbance of pipeline sediments in the water main. The discoloration is caused by dissolved iron which is stirred up in naturally-occurring sediments that exist in all water systems. Any of the following circumstances may have caused flow reversals in the water mains and sediment to be disturbed. The different colors can be attributed to varying chemical oxidation states of the iron (or rust) and by varying concentrations of the rust in the water. The discolored water may be due to planned cleaning of the water main to remove pipeline sediments in your area. A nearby water hydrant may have been knocked over due to a vehicle collision or may be in use to fight a fire. There may be some pipeline repair work (or construction activity) in the area and some valves may have been closed for this work. Despite its appearance, this does not indicate that the water is unsafe or that the integrity of the water main has been compromised. A disinfectant residual is maintained at all times to ensure that the water is safe for household use, including cooking and drinking. For aesthetic reasons, you should avoid doing laundry until the water clears up. ( Return to top )  Blue Color Having blue water is rare. The blue disinfectant you use in your toilet can cause discoloration of your tap water. If your water supply was recently turned off, a condition may have been created in which water from the toilet tank was siphoned into the plumbing of your house. These disinfectants contain chemicals that may pose health hazards if ingested or touched. Flush your plumbing by opening each tap until the water runs clear. \u00a0Do not drink this water.\u00a0 Blue (or blue-green) water may be due to extreme copper plumbing corrosion, which is also a rare circumstance. If this is happening, the water will usually have a bluish-green tint and/or will leave a bluish-green stain around fixtures and on a white surface if the water drips from a faucet. This copper corrosion can be caused by your electrical system being grounded to your water pipes, especially if you have a mixture of pipe material (i.e, some copper and some galvanized iron). ( Return to top )  Green Color Standing water, such as in a white bathtub, will sometimes appear to have a greenish cast to it. Fluorescent lights will make your water appear green. To test this, fill a white bucket with water and take it outside. In the sunlight, the water will look clear and no longer appear green. ( Return to top )  Purging Discolored Water Wait an hour before resuming normal water use to let normal flow patterns re-establish themselves and any remaining sediment to settle down. Flush water at full force from your front hose bib until it runs clear. This should take no more than two or three minutes. If the water continues to be discolored, wait an additional hour and try again before proceeding to the next step. Start by flushing the cold water faucet in the bathtub. If you are concerned about wasting water, water the backyard from the backyard hose bib for several minutes or until the water clears. After the tub or backyard faucet runs clear, flush all of the other cold water household faucets (starting from the side of the house nearest the street, then the rest of the cold water faucets within the home). If discolored water has been drawn into the hot water system, the hot water can continue to be used until the discoloration dissipates and is no longer an aesthetic issue. This is generally preferred to draining and refilling the water heater which may require expert help (calling a plumber) if you are unfamiliar on how to do this safely. Following this guidance generally will take care of the problem. However, depending on the pattern of water use in your neighborhood, it may be necessary to repeat the process more than once if the discoloration continues. If the discoloration persists for more than a day, call ACWD at 510-668-6500. ( Return to top )  Floating Particles Black Particles Black particles can come from three common sources: a broken water filter, a degrading faucet washer or gasket, or a disintegrating black rubber flexible supply line hose (for a water heater, washing machine, or kitchen faucet, etc.). If the particles are very hard, similar in size and shape, and look like large coffee grounds, they are probably granular activated carbon (GAC) particles from the inside of a GAC water filter that you have installed. Replace the filter cartridge or consult with the manufacturer or the vendor who sold it to you. If the particles are solid but rubbery in texture, they could be pieces of an old disintegrating faucet washer or gasket. If this is the problem, the particles would likely only be present at one faucet and that faucet is already leaking. Replace the faucet washers and the packing at the ends of the supply lines. If the particles are small black particles that can be easily smeared between two fingers, they are probably from the inside of a flexible hose. These black rubber hoses are covered with a braided stainless steel mesh. Over time, the chloramine in the water causes the rubber to break down. Replace the hose, ideally with a liner that is identified as chemical or chloramine resistant. Black rubber hoses typically have a one-year warranty while the more chemical resistant hoses have a five-year warranty. ( Return to top )  Brown or Orange Particles Brown or orange particles are typically rust particles that have broken off the inside of your water pipes or the ACWD water mains. These particles are very hard, irregular in size and shape, and can be several different colors (including black). They consist of mostly iron and are not a health hazard but they are a nuisance if they clog washing machine screens, shower heads, or faucet aerators. Another common cause of brown or orange particles in the water is a broken water softener. A water softener contains many small, round beads (or resin) for softening water. The beads will be uniform in size, typically the size of fish eggs, and are brown or orange. The mechanism that keeps these beads in the tank can break, releasing them into your water. Call your service agent for repairs. ( Return to top )  White Particles White or tan particles in the water usually come from internal plumbing. This material is pipe scale and is a combination of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Calcium and magnesium carbonates are naturally occurring minerals and are not a health hazard. Over time, these minerals can deposit on the inside of your pipes and then begin to flake off. Although this process usually occurs slowly over a long period of time, there are three common circumstances that can cause it to happen rapidly: If your water was turned off for repair work, the pressure and turbulence created when it is turned back on can dislodge the minerals from the pipes If you install a water softener, the softer water can begin to re-dissolve the minerals from the pipes and pieces may begin to break loose If you have galvanized iron pipes, they will corrode over time and gradually swell up on the inside, causing the minerals to flake off (Although pipe scale is not a health hazard, it can clog washing machine screens, shower heads, and faucet aerators. There is no practical way to remove pipe scale from the inside of your pipes; if the problem is severe, you may want to consider re-plumbing.) The water heater is another source for white or tan particles. As the water is heated, calcium and magnesium carbonates precipitate out of the water, forming white or tan sand-like deposits. As you use the hot water, these minerals can be carried along clogging washing machine screens, shower heads, and faucet aerators. To keep mineral deposits from accumulating in the water heater, flush your water heater at least once a year. Flushing regularly also extends the life of the heater and makes it operate more fuel efficiently. Instructions for flushing can be found in the Water Quality FAQ on hardness. If you are experiencing floating white particles, the water heater is the likely culprit. A water heater contains a plastic dip tube, which is an extension to the inlet of the water supply. The tube directs the cold incoming water to the bottom of the tank. As the tube gets old, it can disintegrate, sending white particles into the hot water. These particles are brittle and vary in size from small irregular pebbles to longer shards. Contact the manufacturer or vendor for advice on how best to repair the water heater. ( Return to top )  Crystals or White Residue The crystals or sediment left behind on fixtures, white surfaces, and pots after water evaporates are calcium and magnesium carbonates. These are naturally occurring minerals and do not pose a health hazard. These deposits may appear green, blue, or brown, having been colored by tiny amounts of the metals found in your water pipes. Carbonate deposits can be dissolved with white vinegar. Dishwasher deposits can be minimized by using a commercial conditioner, by using liquid detergents and by using the air-dry instead of the power-dry setting on your dishwasher, which bakes the carbonates onto glassware. ( Return to top )  Taste If you recently moved to the ACWD service area, your new water may taste different to you. Just as various brands of bottled water taste different due to the varying minerals they contain, the taste of domestic drinking water also varies with its source(s). Over time, you will become accustomed to its taste. Be assured that the drinking water that ACWD provides meets or surpasses all State and federal drinking water standards. ( Return to top )  Odor The first step in understanding the source of an odor is to determine if the problem exists in the public water supply or in your plumbing. If the water supply is causing the odor, you will experience the odor at every water faucet and it will be persistent. If the source of the odor is in your plumbing, you will experience the odor in only one or several, but not all, of the faucets. If the problem goes away after running the water for a few minutes, the cause is somewhere in your plumbing. If your plumbing is the source of the odor, you can try flush the plumbing system or you can consult a licensed plumber. Contact ACWD at 510-668-6500 if you suspect the public water supply. When you detect an odor in your tap water, we recommend that you perform what we calla glass test at the faucet where you detect the odor. Run the cold water tap for 20 to 30 seconds Get a clean glass Fill and rinse twice with cold tap water. Fill the glass and turn off the faucet Step away from the sink (This eliminates the possibility of mistaking odors from your drain for odors in your water.) Smell the water in the glass and characterize the odor, if any ( Return to top )  Chemical / Medicinal Odor If the odor is medicinal, it is most likely the chloramine (also called total chlorine) that ACWD uses to disinfect the water to ensure that it is safe to drink. ( Return to top )  Chlorine Odor If you detect a chlorine odor, it is most likely the chloramine (also called total chlorine) that ACWD uses to disinfect the water to ensure that it is safe to drink. Although the total chlorine level is a fraction of what is found in pools and spas, you may occasionally detect the smell of chlorine in your water. This odor may be particularly strong in the shower since chlorine is released to the air more rapidly when mixed with hot water. ( Return to top )  Foul / Sulfur / Rotten Egg / Sewage Odor Cold Water:  If the odor is not evident in the glass, but is noticeable when the cold water is running and you are standing at the sink, then the odor is most likely coming from the drain. This problem is easily solved by filling the sink with hot water, adding a few ounces of chlorine bleach, and allowing the hot chlorinated water to flush and disinfect the drain. It is also good practice to periodically remove and clean the sin stopper. The garbage disposal in the kitchen sink can be cleaned in a similar manner. Hot Water: If you find these odors in your hot water, there are two probable causes: Bacteria may be residing in the water heater. Disinfecting the water heater may eliminate this odor. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the Water Quality FAQ for hardness. The water heater anode may need to be replaced. If experienced, inspect the anode yourself; otherwise, call a plumber. ( Return to top )  Swampy / Fishy / Earthy / Musty / Moldy / Grassy Odor These odors may be caused by an algae bloom in a water source reservoir. Typically this is a short-lived event. Contact ACWD if you would like more information. ( Return to top )  Gasoline, Turpentine, or Organic Solvent Odor If you smell gasoline or an organic solvent odor in the cold water, call ACWD at 510-668-6500 immediately for further assistance. This problem is rare and potentially serious. Do not use the water.\u00a0 It is possible that your meter box was exposed to a hazardous substance.

In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t               \u25bc  Lead Information\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   What is lead?    Lead is a metal found in natural deposits and can be found in all parts of our environment, indoors and out. Lead was commonly used in older household plumbing materials until 1986 when the plumbing rules changed and required pipes, fittings and fixtures to be \u201clead-free.\u201d  The most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach lead into the water, especially hot water. \t\t\t         2.   How does it get into drinking water?    Lead can get into drinking water when service lines, household pipes, or household fixtures corrode, but ACWD is fortunate in that we do not have lead service lines and our source water does not contain lead.  Our corrosion control program, described below, helps to limit leaching of lead by preventing the corrosion of household pipes and fixtures.\t\t\t         3.   What is ACWD doing to keep lead out of my water?    Since the 1990s ACWD has been proactively monitoring and adjusting the water quality, specifically pH, at our treatment plants daily so the water is not corrosive to household pipes and plumbing fixtures. In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t\t         4.   How do I know ACWD's Corrosion Control Program is working?    The results of our 2015 testing demonstrates that our Corrosion Control Program is effective.  Every three years we work with at least 50 homeowners to collect a water sample from inside their homes. These samples are considered to be worst-case scenario because they are collected after the water has been still for at least 6 hours (so the water is in contact with the household plumbing for a long time), and the home\u2019s plumbing was in place before the 1986 lead ban (so the plumbing is more likely to have lead). These samples are analyzed by our State-certified laboratory and results are reported to the California Division of Drinking Water, our Board of Directors, the public, and most importantly the homeowners who collected samples.  As part of our compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, these results are compared to the Action Level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). ACWD is in compliance with the Lead Action Level because 90% or more of our samples are below the 15 ppb Action Level. In 2015, 90% of our samples were 8.1 ppb of lead or less. \t\t\t         5.   What can I do to keep lead out of my water?    Even with an effective Corrosion Control Program in place, customers may choose to take steps on their own to further minimize the potential for lead in drinking water, including:  - Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing  baby formula.  - Run the water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby formula. This water is great to use for watering plants! - Consider using a certified water filter to remove lead. Be sure to check that it is certified for lead removal. - Replace old plumbing or fixtures that may have lead. Lead pipes will have a dull gray look and can easily be scratched by a key.\t\t\t         6.   Can you test my water for me?     ACWD does not test customer's water for lead on a regular basis. However, select homes are tested for our Lead and Copper Rule compliance every three years. Although testing has concluded for 2018, we will be testing again in 2021. You can have your water tested by any state-certified lab. ACWD provides as a courtesy to its customers a list of local state-certified commercial laboratories.

What is lead?    Lead is a metal found in natural deposits and can be found in all parts of our environment, indoors and out. Lead was commonly used in older household plumbing materials until 1986 when the plumbing rules changed and required pipes, fittings and fixtures to be \u201clead-free.\u201d  The most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach lead into the water, especially hot water. \t\t\t         2.   How does it get into drinking water?    Lead can get into drinking water when service lines, household pipes, or household fixtures corrode, but ACWD is fortunate in that we do not have lead service lines and our source water does not contain lead.  Our corrosion control program, described below, helps to limit leaching of lead by preventing the corrosion of household pipes and fixtures.\t\t\t         3.   What is ACWD doing to keep lead out of my water?    Since the 1990s ACWD has been proactively monitoring and adjusting the water quality, specifically pH, at our treatment plants daily so the water is not corrosive to household pipes and plumbing fixtures. In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t\t         4.   How do I know ACWD's Corrosion Control Program is working?    The results of our 2015 testing demonstrates that our Corrosion Control Program is effective.  Every three years we work with at least 50 homeowners to collect a water sample from inside their homes. These samples are considered to be worst-case scenario because they are collected after the water has been still for at least 6 hours (so the water is in contact with the household plumbing for a long time), and the home\u2019s plumbing was in place before the 1986 lead ban (so the plumbing is more likely to have lead). These samples are analyzed by our State-certified laboratory and results are reported to the California Division of Drinking Water, our Board of Directors, the public, and most importantly the homeowners who collected samples.  As part of our compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, these results are compared to the Action Level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). ACWD is in compliance with the Lead Action Level because 90% or more of our samples are below the 15 ppb Action Level. In 2015, 90% of our samples were 8.1 ppb of lead or less. \t\t\t         5.   What can I do to keep lead out of my water?    Even with an effective Corrosion Control Program in place, customers may choose to take steps on their own to further minimize the potential for lead in drinking water, including:  - Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing  baby formula.  - Run the water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby formula. This water is great to use for watering plants! - Consider using a certified water filter to remove lead. Be sure to check that it is certified for lead removal. - Replace old plumbing or fixtures that may have lead. Lead pipes will have a dull gray look and can easily be scratched by a key.\t\t\t         6.   Can you test my water for me?     ACWD does not test customer's water for lead on a regular basis. However, select homes are tested for our Lead and Copper Rule compliance every three years. Although testing has concluded for 2018, we will be testing again in 2021.

What is lead?    Lead is a metal found in natural deposits and can be found in all parts of our environment, indoors and out. Lead was commonly used in older household plumbing materials until 1986 when the plumbing rules changed and required pipes, fittings and fixtures to be \u201clead-free.\u201d  The most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach lead into the water, especially hot water. \t\t\t         2.   How does it get into drinking water?    Lead can get into drinking water when service lines, household pipes, or household fixtures corrode, but ACWD is fortunate in that we do not have lead service lines and our source water does not contain lead.  Our corrosion control program, described below, helps to limit leaching of lead by preventing the corrosion of household pipes and fixtures.\t\t\t         3.   What is ACWD doing to keep lead out of my water?    Since the 1990s ACWD has been proactively monitoring and adjusting the water quality, specifically pH, at our treatment plants daily so the water is not corrosive to household pipes and plumbing fixtures. In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t\t         4.   How do I know ACWD's Corrosion Control Program is working?    The results of our 2015 testing demonstrates that our Corrosion Control Program is effective.  Every three years we work with at least 50 homeowners to collect a water sample from inside their homes. These samples are considered to be worst-case scenario because they are collected after the water has been still for at least 6 hours (so the water is in contact with the household plumbing for a long time), and the home\u2019s plumbing was in place before the 1986 lead ban (so the plumbing is more likely to have lead). These samples are analyzed by our State-certified laboratory and results are reported to the California Division of Drinking Water, our Board of Directors, the public, and most importantly the homeowners who collected samples.  As part of our compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, these results are compared to the Action Level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). ACWD is in compliance with the Lead Action Level because 90% or more of our samples are below the 15 ppb Action Level. In 2015, 90% of our samples were 8.1 ppb of lead or less. \t\t\t         5.   What can I do to keep lead out of my water?    Even with an effective Corrosion Control Program in place, customers may choose to take steps on their own to further minimize the potential for lead in drinking water, including:  - Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing  baby formula.  - Run the water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby formula. This water is great to use for watering plants! - Consider using a certified water filter to remove lead. Be sure to check that it is certified for lead removal. - Replace old plumbing or fixtures that may have lead. Lead pipes will have a dull gray look and can easily be scratched by a key.\t\t\t         6.   Can you test my water for me?     ACWD does not test customer's water for lead on a regular basis. However, select homes are tested for our Lead and Copper Rule compliance every three years. Although testing has concluded for 2018, we will be testing again in 2021.

What is the difference between hard and soft water?    Put quite simply, hard water has more minerals in it than soft water. Calcium carbonate is the mineral most commonly associated with water hardness. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold by your local drug or health food store. Hard water reduces the \u201csudsing\u201d ability of soap and causes the spots on your dishes and glasses after washing and air-drying.  \t\t\t         2.   What is the white residue I find at the bottom of my pots and tea kettle, and around my faucet fixtures? What can I do to get rid of it?    The white residue is calcium carbonate. There are cleaning products on the market made specifically for its removal. A \u201cgreen\u201d alternative for removing hardness residue is warm vinegar. Add \u00bd cup of white distilled vinegar to the tea kettle or pot, fill with water, and let sit overnight. Persistent residue can be removed by warming vinegar in the kettle or pot, cooling, and rinsing well afterwards.\t\t\t More information about removing calcium carbonate           3.   Is calcium carbonate bad for me?    No, calcium carbonate is an essential nutrient that is used by your body to fortify bones and teeth. It also helps your muscles to function properly.\t\t\t         4.   What is my water hardness in grains/gallon?    In most cases, water quality parameters are reported in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L).  To convert hardness in ppm (or mg/L) to grains per gallon (gpg), simply divide by 17.1.  For example, water hardness of 100 ppm equals 100/17.1 or 5.85 gpg.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

What is lead?    Lead is a metal found in natural deposits and can be found in all parts of our environment, indoors and out. Lead was commonly used in older household plumbing materials until 1986 when the plumbing rules changed and required pipes, fittings and fixtures to be \u201clead-free.\u201d  The most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach lead into the water, especially hot water. \t\t\t         2.   How does it get into drinking water?    Lead can get into drinking water when service lines, household pipes, or household fixtures corrode, but ACWD is fortunate in that we do not have lead service lines and our source water does not contain lead.  Our corrosion control program, described below, helps to limit leaching of lead by preventing the corrosion of household pipes and fixtures.\t\t\t         3.   What is ACWD doing to keep lead out of my water?    Since the 1990s ACWD has been proactively monitoring and adjusting the water quality, specifically pH, at our treatment plants daily so the water is not corrosive to household pipes and plumbing fixtures. In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t\t         4.   How do I know ACWD's Corrosion Control Program is working?    The results of our 2015 testing demonstrates that our Corrosion Control Program is effective.  Every three years we work with at least 50 homeowners to collect a water sample from inside their homes. These samples are considered to be worst-case scenario because they are collected after the water has been still for at least 6 hours (so the water is in contact with the household plumbing for a long time), and the home\u2019s plumbing was in place before the 1986 lead ban (so the plumbing is more likely to have lead). These samples are analyzed by our State-certified laboratory and results are reported to the California Division of Drinking Water, our Board of Directors, the public, and most importantly the homeowners who collected samples.  As part of our compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, these results are compared to the Action Level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). ACWD is in compliance with the Lead Action Level because 90% or more of our samples are below the 15 ppb Action Level. In 2015, 90% of our samples were 8.1 ppb of lead or less. \t\t\t         5.   What can I do to keep lead out of my water?    Even with an effective Corrosion Control Program in place, customers may choose to take steps on their own to further minimize the potential for lead in drinking water, including:  - Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing  baby formula.  - Run the water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby formula. This water is great to use for watering plants! - Consider using a certified water filter to remove lead. Be sure to check that it is certified for lead removal. - Replace old plumbing or fixtures that may have lead. Lead pipes will have a dull gray look and can easily be scratched by a key.\t\t\t         6.   Can you test my water for me?     ACWD does not test customer's water for lead on a regular basis. However, select homes are tested for our Lead and Copper Rule compliance every three years. Although testing has concluded for 2018, we will be testing again in 2021.

Does ACWD fluoridate its water?     Yes, voters required\u00a0the addition of fluoride in the early 1970\u2019s and ACWD began fluoridating drinking water in 1976.           2.   Why do you fluoridate the drinking water?    Fluoride is added to your drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. Although fluoride is found naturally in almost all water sources, it is generally not enough to provide oral health benefits. Drinking fluoridated water benefits the whole community, including people of all ages and especially low-income and underserved populations. \t\t\t         3.   What is fluoride?    Fluoride is a naturally-occurring element found in rocks and soil. As water passes through and over soil and rock formations containing fluoride, the fluoride dissolves into the water.\t\t\t         4.   How much fluoride is added to my water?    ACWD supplements the naturally-occurring fluoride in your drinking water to meet the California State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Drinking Water (DDW) recommended optimal level of 0.7 parts per million (ppm). Samples are collected daily to ensure that the fluoride level is within the State-specified control range of 0.6-1.2 ppm.\t\t\t         5.   How does ACWD monitor the fluoride level in my water?    ACWD uses continuous monitoring equipment at each of its treatment facilities. Water samples are also collected and analyzed daily from 53 locations throughout the service area. Compliance reports are submitted monthly to the DDW, the Alameda County Public Health Department, and the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency. \t\t\t         6.   What do health professionals say about fluoride?    Medical and dental experts endorse water fluoridation as the single most effective public health measure to improve oral health. For over 65 years, drinking fluoridated water has been scientifically proven to be safe and effective.  Local, state, and national health organizations emphasize the benefits of fluoridation for community prevention of tooth decay and maintain that fluoride poses no health threat. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention proclaimed fluoridation to be one of the top ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.           7.   What are the regulations on fluoridating drinking water?    Assembly Bill 733, signed into law in 1995, requires large water systems to fluoridate their public water supplies. It also directs DDW to seek funding for fluoridation. In April 1998, DDW adopted regulations to enforce the water fluoridation requirements in AB 733.  Senate Bill 96, passed in 2004, further reinforced community water fluoridation as a statewide public health priority and preempted local regulations.            8.   Do statewide regulations regarding fluoridation apply to ACWD?    Yes, statewide regulations apply to large water systems with at least 10,000 service connections and require that:  Large systems with existing fluoridation practices continue fluoridating, and  Large non-fluoridated systems start fluoridating when funding is made available  ACWD delivers water to over 80,000 service connections and is required to fluoridate in order to stay compliant.           9.   Should I use fluoride supplements?    Drinking fluoridated water on a regular basis makes the use of fluoride supplements unnecessary. Simultaneous use of fluoride supplements and drinking fluoridated water is not recommended by health professionals. Contact your health care or dental care provider if you have questions about fluoride supplements. \t\t\t         10.   Is fluoride okay for my pets?    Fluoride in levels administered for drinking water is safe for humans and all animals. Fluoridated water has no effect on the growth of tropical fish or goldfish. Research and experience have shown that fluoridation at optimal levels does not harm people or the environment. \t\t\t         11.   If I have water filter, is it removing the fluoride?    To find out if fluoride is being removed, check with the filter manufacturer. Typically, carafe filters, faucet filters, and carbon filters do not remove fluoride.\t\t\t         12.   If I do not want to drink fluoridated tap water, how can I remove the fluoride?    There are four different ways to remove fluoride from tap water: activated alumina filters, distillation, reverse osmosis, and anion exchange. No treatment method will remove all of the fluoride. Consult with the manufacturers on the amount of fluoride their products can remove.  The most effective whole house filtration method for removing fluoride is reverse osmosis which has up to 80-90% efficiency. Water distillation systems remove up to 100% of fluoride, and bottled water does not generally contain fluoride.  The following products or procedures will NOT remove fluoride:  - Activated carbon filters - Water softeners - Boiling water - concentrates fluoride rather than reduces it.  - Refrigerating or freezing water - has no effect on the concentration of fluoride in the water            13.   Which organizations endorse water fluoridation?

Why is my drinking water discolored (yellow, brown, black)?    Water main breaks, firefighting activities, extremely high system demand, and the start-up or shut-down of a water treatment facility can increase the velocity at which water travels through water mains. If the water\u2019s speed becomes great enough, iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the mains may get stirred up, resulting in discolored water.           2.   Is discolored water from these activities safe to drink?     Discolored water caused by iron and manganese oxide sediment is safe to drink. During such discolored water episodes, your water continues to meet or surpass all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. ACWD cleans  its water mains  annually to remove sediment, which helps to minimize discolored water episodes. For further details regarding this program, visit the District's  Main Cleaning Program  page.           3.   What should I do if my drinking water becomes discolored?    If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears. To remove the discoloration, flush the pipes in your house using the following procedure:  1. Run the outside front hose faucet at full force for a few minutes or until the water clears. 2. If the water does not clear after a few minutes, wait another hour and repeat the process until the water is clear at the outside front hose faucet. 3.Flush the cold water faucets throughout the house. Start by flushing the cold water faucet in the bathtub. If you are concerned about wasting water, water the backyard from the backyard hose bib for several minutes or until the water clears.  4. After the tub or backyard faucet runs clear, flush all of the other cold water household faucets; starting from the front of the house (nearest the street), then the rest of the cold water faucets within the home.  5. If necessary, remove faucet aerators and clear any particles and then reinstall them. If the water still fails to clear, contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.           4.   After flushing my pipes, my cold water runs clear but my hot water is still discolored. What should I do?    If discolored water has been drawn into the hot water system, the hot water can continue to be used until the discoloration dissipates and is no longer an aesthetic issue. This is generally preferred to draining and refilling the water heater which may require expert help (calling a plumber).  \t\t\t How to flush a water heater           5.   My clothes have been stained by discolored water. What can I do to remove the stains?    You may use commonly available stain removal products that can be purchased at any supermarket. Contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500 if you need further assistance.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Why is chlorine added to the tap water?    Chlorine disinfection is used to kill microbes that could be harmful to your health.  It is an important treatment process that ensures your tap water is safe to drink.\t\t\t         2.   What are chlorination byproducts?    Chlorination byproducts are chemical compounds formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter in water. Total trihalomethanes are a specific group of regulated compounds formed when chlorination is practiced.\t\t\t         3.   What steps has ACWD taken to ensure that chlorination byproducts are minimized?    1. Routinely controlling and monitoring water treatment processes to limit the formation of chlorination byproducts.  2. Monitoring for total trihalomethanes at representative locations throughout the distribution system as required by State and federal regulations.  3. Reviewing the latest regulations and health effects information, and employing improved treatment strategies to ensure that facilities are operated to further limit the formation of chlorination byproducts. \t\t\t         4.   Does ACWD meet current state and federal regulations for total trihalomethanes?    Yes. ACWD regularly monitors for these chlorination byproducts and meets state and federal regulations which require that the running average concentration of total trihalomethanes remain below 80 \u00b5g/L. \t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Why are chloramines toxic to fish?     Chloramines are safe for humans but toxic to fish.  When chloramines, a combination of chlorine and ammonia, break down either naturally or through the use chlorine removing chemicals, ammonia is released.  The ammonia can be removed from fish tanks or ponds by using commercial products available at pet supply stores.  Biological filters, natural zeolites and pH control methods are also effective in reducing the toxic effects of ammonia.\t\t\t         2.   Are chloramines toxic to both saltwater and freshwater fish?    Yes. Chloramines affect saltwater fish in the same way they affect freshwater fish.\t\t\t         3.   Do chloramines pose a hazard to koi?    Yes. Koi are just as susceptible to chloramines as other fish.\t\t\t         4.   Will letting water sit for a few days cause chloramines to disappear?    No. Unlike chlorine, which dissipates when water sits for a few days, chloramines may take weeks to disappear. \t\t\t         5.   Do chloramines have to be removed if only a small amount of water is added to an aquarium or pond to make up for evaporation loss?    To know for sure, you'll have to monitor for total chlorine residual. Chloramine residuals in water used to keep fish should be kept below 0.1 mg/L. Total chlorine test kits are available from pet stores, pool supply stores and chemical supply houses. Make sure, however, that the kit is for \"total chlorine\" or \"combined chlorine,\" not \"free chlorine.\" A free chlorine test of chloraminated water would read zero but still be toxic to fish.\t\t\t         6.   Will a carbon filter remove chloramines?    No. Most carbon filters will not remove chloramines.\t\t\t         7.   Will reverse osmosis remove chloramines?    No. Salts can be caught by the permeable membrane but chloramines pass through easily.\t\t\t         8.   Will boiling remove chloramines from water?    No. Boiling is not an effective way to remove chloramines from water. The only practical methods of removing chloramines from water are using a water conditioner which contains a dechloraminator or by using a granular activated carbon. Ask your pet supplier for instructions on how to use these products.\t\t\t         9.   Who can I contact if I have additional questions about chloramines?    If you have questions or comments about chloramination, please contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

The water heater will operate more fuel efficiently and will last longer.  The water heater will also need to be flushed if the hot water becomes yellow or brown due to an accumulation of rust or if you find sand-like mineral sediment in the hot water.  If you do not feel comfortable doing this work yourself, hire a licensed plumber to do it for you. 1. Do not shut off the gas or the water supply to the heater.  2. Attach a garden hose to the draincock located at the bottom of the heater. The draincock usually looks like a regular hose bib (garden faucet) or a round dial with a threaded hole in the middle.  3. Extend the garden hose to a place where the water can safely exit the heater (e.g. a drain, a driveway, etc.).  4. Open the draincock to allow the water to exit the heater. Caution: the water leaving the heater will be hot and under normal household water pressure. Also note that if the draincock is made of plastic and the heater is several years old, it may be difficult to open and may break easily if forced.  5. After five minutes of flushing, fill a bucket with the still flushing water.  6. Allow the water in the bucket to stand undisturbed for a minute and see if the water has cleared or if any sand-like material settles to the bottom. If the water has cleared and no sand-like material is observed, go on to step 7. If the water is discolored and/or sand-like material is observed at the bottom of the bucket, repeat steps 5 and 6 until the water is completely clear and free of sediment.  7. Close the draincock and remove the garden hose.                  \u25bc  Domestic Plumbing FAQs\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?    The water coming into your home is controlled by the house valve, which can be found ahead of the water spigot in your front yard. (If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t\t         2.   How do I disinfect a drain?    The odor of rotten eggs or sewage in the water is usually caused by sewer gases forming in the household drain. These gases are formed by bacteria which live on food, soap, hair, and other organic matter in the drain. These gases are heavier than air and remain in the drain until the water is turned on. As the water runs down the drain, the gases are expelled into the atmosphere around the sink. It is natural to associate these odors with the water because they are observed only when the water is turned on. However, the odor is not in the water, it is simply the water pushing the gas out of the drain.  Disinfecting the drain will remove the bacteria in the drain that are causing these foul odors.  Caution: do not mix any drain cleaners or detergents with bleach; certain combinations can create toxic fumes.  1. Run the cold water for about 15 seconds into the drain that is to be disinfected, then turn the water off.  2. Pour approximately one to two cups of liquid chlorine bleach (laundry bleach) down the drain. Pour the bleach slowly around the edges of the drain so that it runs down the sides of the drain. Be careful: bleach may cause eye damage, skin irritation, and may damage clothing. 3. If the odor is coming from a sink with a garbage disposal, turn the disposal on for a few seconds while the bleach is being poured. This will disperse the bleach around the inside of the disposal. Caution: take care to avoid splashing for the few seconds the disposal is turned on. Bleach may cause eye damage, skin irritation, and may damage clothing.  4. Allow the bleach to remain undisturbed in the drain for about 10 minutes. Caution: prolonged contact with metals may cause pitting and/or discoloration.  5. After 10 minutes, run hot water into the drain for a minute or two to flush out the bleach. If a garbage disposal was disinfected, thoroughly flush it as well.  6. Repeat this procedure if the odor returns.            3.   How do I heat-disinfect my water heater?    A sulfurous or rotten egg-like odor in the hot water is caused by bacteria growing in the water heater. This growth usually happens when the water heater is turned off while on vacation, when the hot water has not been used for a long time, or when the temperature setting on the heater is set too low. While the bacteria in the water heater are not a health threat, they must be eliminated to remove the odor problem. Heat disinfection is used to eliminate the bacteria. It involves draining the water heater, maximizing the temperature in the water heater, and then draining the water heater again.  If you do not feel comfortable doing this work yourself, hire a licensed plumber to do it for you.  1. Select a time to drain the water heater. We recommend an evening since this will minimize the impact your typical use of hot water. 2. Turn the thermostat on the heater off so that only the pilot light remains on. If the heater is drained while the heating flame is on, the heater may be damaged.  3. Turn off the water supply to the water heater. There may be a valve to do this right at the inlet to the water heater, or the water supply to the entire property may need to be shut off at the house valve.  4. Open one or more hot water faucets inside the house. This allows air to enter the heater as the water drains out in step 6.  5. Attach a garden hose to the draincock located at the bottom of the water heater. The draincock usually looks like a regular hose bib (garden faucet) or a round dial with a threaded hole in the middle.  6. Extend the garden hose to a place where the water can be disposed of (e.g. a drain, the driveway, etc.).  7. Open the draincock and allow all of the water to drain out of the water heater. This can take anywhere from five minutes to half an hour or more depending on the capacity of the heater and the size of the draincock. Caution: the draining water will be very hot. Also note that if the draincock is made of plastic and the water heater is several years old, it may be difficult to open and may break easily if forced.  8. When the water heater is empty, close the draincock and remove the garden hose.  9. Turn the water supply to the water heater back on. Leave the hot water faucet(s) inside the house turned on. This will allow the air in the water heater to escape as it refills with water. There will likely be \"hissing\" sounds and/or \"spitting and sputtering\" as air and water begin coming out of the hot water faucets. When the water flow from the faucet(s) returns to normal, shut them off.  10. That night (before going to bed), turn the thermostat for the water heater to its highest temperature setting for one night. Caution: make sure everyone who uses the water is aware that the hot water is going to be hotter than usual.  11. The next morning, turn the thermostat on the heater off so that only the pilot light remains on. If the heater is drained while the heating flame is on, the heater may be damaged.  12. Drain and refill the water heater by repeating steps 2 through 8.  13. Return the thermostat on the water heater to the normal setting (usually around 130\u00b0F).            4.
