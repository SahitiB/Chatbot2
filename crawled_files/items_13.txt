CIMIS helps agricultural growers and turf managers administering parks, golf courses and other landscapes to develop water budgets for determining when to irrigate and how much water to apply. Providing information for improving water and energy management through efficient irrigation practices is the primary use of the CIMIS system. History CIMIS was developed by the California Department of Water Resources and the University of California at Davis. Operational since 1982, it is continually updated to employ the latest technology. Access to CIMIS is free and the system operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year except during maintenance hours. Data is accessible through the internet at the  CIMIS website . The ACWD & CIMIS Partnership ACWD, the Department of Water Resources and Union City joined forces to install a station at Town Estates Park in Union City in 2000. Union City CIMIS Station Number 171 meets all the conditions needed to provide accurate weather information. Need More Info? For additional information about CIMIS or to learn how to use the station, go to the  CIMIS website . To gain access to the information provided by CIMIS Station Number 171, click on the \"CIMIS DATA\" tab and register as a user.

In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t               \u25bc  Lead Information\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   What is lead?    Lead is a metal found in natural deposits and can be found in all parts of our environment, indoors and out. Lead was commonly used in older household plumbing materials until 1986 when the plumbing rules changed and required pipes, fittings and fixtures to be \u201clead-free.\u201d  The most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach lead into the water, especially hot water. \t\t\t         2.   How does it get into drinking water?    Lead can get into drinking water when service lines, household pipes, or household fixtures corrode, but ACWD is fortunate in that we do not have lead service lines and our source water does not contain lead.  Our corrosion control program, described below, helps to limit leaching of lead by preventing the corrosion of household pipes and fixtures.\t\t\t         3.

How do I know ACWD's Corrosion Control Program is working?    The results of our 2015 testing demonstrates that our Corrosion Control Program is effective.  Every three years we work with at least 50 homeowners to collect a water sample from inside their homes. These samples are considered to be worst-case scenario because they are collected after the water has been still for at least 6 hours (so the water is in contact with the household plumbing for a long time), and the home\u2019s plumbing was in place before the 1986 lead ban (so the plumbing is more likely to have lead). These samples are analyzed by our State-certified laboratory and results are reported to the California Division of Drinking Water, our Board of Directors, the public, and most importantly the homeowners who collected samples.  As part of our compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, these results are compared to the Action Level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). ACWD is in compliance with the Lead Action Level because 90% or more of our samples are below the 15 ppb Action Level. In 2015, 90% of our samples were 8.1 ppb of lead or less. \t\t\t         5.   What can I do to keep lead out of my water?    Even with an effective Corrosion Control Program in place, customers may choose to take steps on their own to further minimize the potential for lead in drinking water, including:  - Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing  baby formula.  - Run the water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby formula. This water is great to use for watering plants! - Consider using a certified water filter to remove lead. Be sure to check that it is certified for lead removal. - Replace old plumbing or fixtures that may have lead. Lead pipes will have a dull gray look and can easily be scratched by a key.\t\t\t         6.   Can you test my water for me?     ACWD does not test customer's water for lead on a regular basis. However, select homes are tested for our Lead and Copper Rule compliance every three years. Although testing has concluded for 2018, we will be testing again in 2021. You can have your water tested by any state-certified lab. ACWD provides as a courtesy to its customers a list of local state-certified commercial laboratories.

What is lead?    Lead is a metal found in natural deposits and can be found in all parts of our environment, indoors and out. Lead was commonly used in older household plumbing materials until 1986 when the plumbing rules changed and required pipes, fittings and fixtures to be \u201clead-free.\u201d  The most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach lead into the water, especially hot water. \t\t\t         2.

What is lead?    Lead is a metal found in natural deposits and can be found in all parts of our environment, indoors and out. Lead was commonly used in older household plumbing materials until 1986 when the plumbing rules changed and required pipes, fittings and fixtures to be \u201clead-free.\u201d  The most common problem is with brass or chrome-plated brass faucets and fixtures which can leach lead into the water, especially hot water. \t\t\t         2.   How does it get into drinking water?    Lead can get into drinking water when service lines, household pipes, or household fixtures corrode, but ACWD is fortunate in that we do not have lead service lines and our source water does not contain lead.  Our corrosion control program, described below, helps to limit leaching of lead by preventing the corrosion of household pipes and fixtures.\t\t\t         3.   What is ACWD doing to keep lead out of my water?    Since the 1990s ACWD has been proactively monitoring and adjusting the water quality, specifically pH, at our treatment plants daily so the water is not corrosive to household pipes and plumbing fixtures. In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t\t         4.   How do I know ACWD's Corrosion Control Program is working?    The results of our 2015 testing demonstrates that our Corrosion Control Program is effective.  Every three years we work with at least 50 homeowners to collect a water sample from inside their homes. These samples are considered to be worst-case scenario because they are collected after the water has been still for at least 6 hours (so the water is in contact with the household plumbing for a long time), and the home\u2019s plumbing was in place before the 1986 lead ban (so the plumbing is more likely to have lead). These samples are analyzed by our State-certified laboratory and results are reported to the California Division of Drinking Water, our Board of Directors, the public, and most importantly the homeowners who collected samples.  As part of our compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, these results are compared to the Action Level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). ACWD is in compliance with the Lead Action Level because 90% or more of our samples are below the 15 ppb Action Level. In 2015, 90% of our samples were 8.1 ppb of lead or less. \t\t\t         5.   What can I do to keep lead out of my water?    Even with an effective Corrosion Control Program in place, customers may choose to take steps on their own to further minimize the potential for lead in drinking water, including:  - Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing  baby formula.  - Run the water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby formula. This water is great to use for watering plants! - Consider using a certified water filter to remove lead. Be sure to check that it is certified for lead removal. - Replace old plumbing or fixtures that may have lead. Lead pipes will have a dull gray look and can easily be scratched by a key.\t\t\t         6.   Can you test my water for me?     ACWD does not test customer's water for lead on a regular basis. However, select homes are tested for our Lead and Copper Rule compliance every three years. Although testing has concluded for 2018, we will be testing again in 2021.

What is the difference between hard and soft water?    Put quite simply, hard water has more minerals in it than soft water. Calcium carbonate is the mineral most commonly associated with water hardness. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold by your local drug or health food store. Hard water reduces the \u201csudsing\u201d ability of soap and causes the spots on your dishes and glasses after washing and air-drying.  \t\t\t         2.   What is the white residue I find at the bottom of my pots and tea kettle, and around my faucet fixtures? What can I do to get rid of it?    The white residue is calcium carbonate. There are cleaning products on the market made specifically for its removal. A \u201cgreen\u201d alternative for removing hardness residue is warm vinegar. Add \u00bd cup of white distilled vinegar to the tea kettle or pot, fill with water, and let sit overnight. Persistent residue can be removed by warming vinegar in the kettle or pot, cooling, and rinsing well afterwards.\t\t\t More information about removing calcium carbonate           3.   Is calcium carbonate bad for me?    No, calcium carbonate is an essential nutrient that is used by your body to fortify bones and teeth. It also helps your muscles to function properly.\t\t\t         4.   What is my water hardness in grains/gallon?    In most cases, water quality parameters are reported in parts per million (ppm) or milligrams per liter (mg/L).  To convert hardness in ppm (or mg/L) to grains per gallon (gpg), simply divide by 17.1.  For example, water hardness of 100 ppm equals 100/17.1 or 5.85 gpg.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

How does it get into drinking water?    Lead can get into drinking water when service lines, household pipes, or household fixtures corrode, but ACWD is fortunate in that we do not have lead service lines and our source water does not contain lead.  Our corrosion control program, described below, helps to limit leaching of lead by preventing the corrosion of household pipes and fixtures.\t\t\t         3.   What is ACWD doing to keep lead out of my water?    Since the 1990s ACWD has been proactively monitoring and adjusting the water quality, specifically pH, at our treatment plants daily so the water is not corrosive to household pipes and plumbing fixtures. In the drinking water industry, this is called a Corrosion Control Program. While some other water utilities need to add corrosion inhibitors to their water, ACWD\u2019s testing has demonstrated that making adjustments to the water\u2019s pH forms a beneficial scale on the inside of pipes. This scale is a physical barrier between any lead that may be in the household pipes or plumbing fixtures and the water, and it prevents the lead from getting into your water. \t\t\t         4.   How do I know ACWD's Corrosion Control Program is working?    The results of our 2015 testing demonstrates that our Corrosion Control Program is effective.  Every three years we work with at least 50 homeowners to collect a water sample from inside their homes. These samples are considered to be worst-case scenario because they are collected after the water has been still for at least 6 hours (so the water is in contact with the household plumbing for a long time), and the home\u2019s plumbing was in place before the 1986 lead ban (so the plumbing is more likely to have lead). These samples are analyzed by our State-certified laboratory and results are reported to the California Division of Drinking Water, our Board of Directors, the public, and most importantly the homeowners who collected samples.  As part of our compliance with the United States Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Lead and Copper Rule, these results are compared to the Action Level of 15 parts per billion (ppb). ACWD is in compliance with the Lead Action Level because 90% or more of our samples are below the 15 ppb Action Level. In 2015, 90% of our samples were 8.1 ppb of lead or less. \t\t\t         5.   What can I do to keep lead out of my water?    Even with an effective Corrosion Control Program in place, customers may choose to take steps on their own to further minimize the potential for lead in drinking water, including:  - Use only water from the cold water tap for drinking, cooking, or preparing  baby formula.  - Run the water for 30 seconds to 2 minutes before using it for drinking, cooking, or preparing baby formula. This water is great to use for watering plants! - Consider using a certified water filter to remove lead. Be sure to check that it is certified for lead removal. - Replace old plumbing or fixtures that may have lead. Lead pipes will have a dull gray look and can easily be scratched by a key.\t\t\t         6.   Can you test my water for me?     ACWD does not test customer's water for lead on a regular basis. However, select homes are tested for our Lead and Copper Rule compliance every three years. Although testing has concluded for 2018, we will be testing again in 2021. You can have your water tested by any state-certified lab. ACWD provides as a courtesy to its customers a list of local state-certified commercial laboratories.

Does ACWD fluoridate its water?     Yes, voters required\u00a0the addition of fluoride in the early 1970\u2019s and ACWD began fluoridating drinking water in 1976.           2.   Why do you fluoridate the drinking water?    Fluoride is added to your drinking water to help prevent tooth decay. Although fluoride is found naturally in almost all water sources, it is generally not enough to provide oral health benefits. Drinking fluoridated water benefits the whole community, including people of all ages and especially low-income and underserved populations. \t\t\t         3.   What is fluoride?    Fluoride is a naturally-occurring element found in rocks and soil. As water passes through and over soil and rock formations containing fluoride, the fluoride dissolves into the water.\t\t\t         4.   How much fluoride is added to my water?    ACWD supplements the naturally-occurring fluoride in your drinking water to meet the California State Water Resources Control Board, Division of Drinking Water (DDW) recommended optimal level of 0.7 parts per million (ppm). Samples are collected daily to ensure that the fluoride level is within the State-specified control range of 0.6-1.2 ppm.\t\t\t         5.   How does ACWD monitor the fluoride level in my water?    ACWD uses continuous monitoring equipment at each of its treatment facilities. Water samples are also collected and analyzed daily from 53 locations throughout the service area. Compliance reports are submitted monthly to the DDW, the Alameda County Public Health Department, and the Alameda County Health Care Services Agency. \t\t\t         6.   What do health professionals say about fluoride?    Medical and dental experts endorse water fluoridation as the single most effective public health measure to improve oral health. For over 65 years, drinking fluoridated water has been scientifically proven to be safe and effective.  Local, state, and national health organizations emphasize the benefits of fluoridation for community prevention of tooth decay and maintain that fluoride poses no health threat. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention proclaimed fluoridation to be one of the top ten greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.           7.   What are the regulations on fluoridating drinking water?    Assembly Bill 733, signed into law in 1995, requires large water systems to fluoridate their public water supplies. It also directs DDW to seek funding for fluoridation. In April 1998, DDW adopted regulations to enforce the water fluoridation requirements in AB 733.  Senate Bill 96, passed in 2004, further reinforced community water fluoridation as a statewide public health priority and preempted local regulations.            8.   Do statewide regulations regarding fluoridation apply to ACWD?    Yes, statewide regulations apply to large water systems with at least 10,000 service connections and require that:  Large systems with existing fluoridation practices continue fluoridating, and  Large non-fluoridated systems start fluoridating when funding is made available  ACWD delivers water to over 80,000 service connections and is required to fluoridate in order to stay compliant.           9.   Should I use fluoride supplements?    Drinking fluoridated water on a regular basis makes the use of fluoride supplements unnecessary. Simultaneous use of fluoride supplements and drinking fluoridated water is not recommended by health professionals. Contact your health care or dental care provider if you have questions about fluoride supplements. \t\t\t         10.   Is fluoride okay for my pets?    Fluoride in levels administered for drinking water is safe for humans and all animals. Fluoridated water has no effect on the growth of tropical fish or goldfish. Research and experience have shown that fluoridation at optimal levels does not harm people or the environment. \t\t\t         11.   If I have water filter, is it removing the fluoride?    To find out if fluoride is being removed, check with the filter manufacturer. Typically, carafe filters, faucet filters, and carbon filters do not remove fluoride.\t\t\t         12.   If I do not want to drink fluoridated tap water, how can I remove the fluoride?    There are four different ways to remove fluoride from tap water: activated alumina filters, distillation, reverse osmosis, and anion exchange. No treatment method will remove all of the fluoride. Consult with the manufacturers on the amount of fluoride their products can remove.  The most effective whole house filtration method for removing fluoride is reverse osmosis which has up to 80-90% efficiency. Water distillation systems remove up to 100% of fluoride, and bottled water does not generally contain fluoride.  The following products or procedures will NOT remove fluoride:  - Activated carbon filters - Water softeners - Boiling water - concentrates fluoride rather than reduces it.  - Refrigerating or freezing water - has no effect on the concentration of fluoride in the water            13.   Which organizations endorse water fluoridation?    The following organizations endorse fluoridation as an important public health measure for reducing tooth decay:  - The American Dental Association  - The American Medical Association  - The American Water Works Association - Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - California Department of Public Health - Alameda County Public Health Department \t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Why is chlorine added to the tap water?    Chlorine disinfection is used to kill microbes that could be harmful to your health.  It is an important treatment process that ensures your tap water is safe to drink.\t\t\t         2.   What are chlorination byproducts?    Chlorination byproducts are chemical compounds formed when chlorine reacts with organic matter in water. Total trihalomethanes are a specific group of regulated compounds formed when chlorination is practiced.\t\t\t         3.   What steps has ACWD taken to ensure that chlorination byproducts are minimized?    1. Routinely controlling and monitoring water treatment processes to limit the formation of chlorination byproducts.  2. Monitoring for total trihalomethanes at representative locations throughout the distribution system as required by State and federal regulations.  3. Reviewing the latest regulations and health effects information, and employing improved treatment strategies to ensure that facilities are operated to further limit the formation of chlorination byproducts. \t\t\t         4.

Why are chloramines toxic to fish?     Chloramines are safe for humans but toxic to fish.  When chloramines, a combination of chlorine and ammonia, break down either naturally or through the use chlorine removing chemicals, ammonia is released.  The ammonia can be removed from fish tanks or ponds by using commercial products available at pet supply stores.  Biological filters, natural zeolites and pH control methods are also effective in reducing the toxic effects of ammonia.\t\t\t         2.   Are chloramines toxic to both saltwater and freshwater fish?    Yes. Chloramines affect saltwater fish in the same way they affect freshwater fish.\t\t\t         3.   Do chloramines pose a hazard to koi?    Yes. Koi are just as susceptible to chloramines as other fish.\t\t\t         4.   Will letting water sit for a few days cause chloramines to disappear?    No. Unlike chlorine, which dissipates when water sits for a few days, chloramines may take weeks to disappear. \t\t\t         5.   Do chloramines have to be removed if only a small amount of water is added to an aquarium or pond to make up for evaporation loss?    To know for sure, you'll have to monitor for total chlorine residual. Chloramine residuals in water used to keep fish should be kept below 0.1 mg/L. Total chlorine test kits are available from pet stores, pool supply stores and chemical supply houses. Make sure, however, that the kit is for \"total chlorine\" or \"combined chlorine,\" not \"free chlorine.\" A free chlorine test of chloraminated water would read zero but still be toxic to fish.\t\t\t         6.   Will a carbon filter remove chloramines?    No. Most carbon filters will not remove chloramines.\t\t\t         7.   Will reverse osmosis remove chloramines?    No. Salts can be caught by the permeable membrane but chloramines pass through easily.\t\t\t         8.   Will boiling remove chloramines from water?    No. Boiling is not an effective way to remove chloramines from water. The only practical methods of removing chloramines from water are using a water conditioner which contains a dechloraminator or by using a granular activated carbon. Ask your pet supplier for instructions on how to use these products.\t\t\t         9.   Who can I contact if I have additional questions about chloramines?    If you have questions or comments about chloramination, please contact ACWD at (510) 668-6500.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

In fact, experts predict a 70% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area within the next 30 years. Are you and your family prepared for such a disaster? While ACWD\u2019s disaster preparedness efforts include extensive measures to protect the water system from damage resulting from earthquakes, many breaks in our water system pipelines will undoubtedly occur. In fact, the damage to ACWD\u2019s system from a major earthquake could be so severe that the reliable supply of high quality drinking water our customers rely upon and have learned to expect could be interrupted for an extended period of time. That\u2019s why one of the most important things that you can do to get ready for an earthquake (or any other disaster) is to store an adequate amount of emergency drinking water. You can survive weeks without food, but only a few days without water. In addition to the emergency preparedness resource links and  FAQs  provided in the menu boxes on the right of this page, ACWD strongly encourages you to complete the  Family Disaster Planning Worksheet (PDF) .                                         Family Disaster Planning Worksheet (PDF) Use this worksheet to create an emergency communications plan, supply kit, and action plans for you and your family. The short amount of time it takes you to complete this worksheet and properly prepare can make all the difference for how well you and your family safely endure a disaster situation!

How much water should I store?     Store at least two gallons of water per person per day, and prepare for a minimum of 3 to 7 days.  For a family of four, this is at least 24 to 56 gallons.  If you have any pets, be sure to store water for them too.  \t\t\t         2.   Is bottled water from the grocery store suitable for storing?     Yes. Bottled water you buy at the grocery store in sealed containers can typically be stored for several years. The bottles should be kept in a cool dark place and should not be exposed to direct sunlight or fumes from petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. You should check the bottles periodically to be sure the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. Replace the bottled water when it reaches the expiration or \u201cuse by\u201d date or if you think the bottles have leaked or lost water due to evaporation.\t\t\t         3.   More Water For Emergencies FAQs    .\t\t\t         4.   Is it safe to store tap water for use during emergencies?     ACWD tap water can be stored safety as long as you take the proper steps to sterilize the storage containers and treat the water before putting it in storage.\t\t\t         5.   What type of container should I use to store the water?     Any clean, airtight container will work, but sturdy, opaque plastic bottles with screw-on caps are preferable. Avoid glass containers that will break easily or paper containers (such as milk cartons) that will weaken over time. Make sure the container has been cleaned with hot, soapy water and rinsed well before filling.\t\t\t         6.   How do I treat the tap water I am planning to store?     Follow the steps below to properly treat the tap water you are storing for emergency use. 1.  Flush the tap for one minute.  This will ensure that any residual metals have been flushed from the home plumbing and that you are getting chlorinated water from the main.   2.  Add \u00bc teaspoon (8 drops) of chlorine bleach for each gallon the container holds. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous. 3.  Fill the container with tap water leaving as little headspace as possible. 4.  Cap the container and tape the lid to keep out dust and dirt. 5.  Place the container in a black garbage bag and close.  This controls dust and prevents algal growth. 6.  Mark the date you filled the bottle on a piece of tape and attach it to the bag. This will allow you to know when it's time to change the water you have stored. The filled water containers should be stored in a cool, dark place and should not be exposed to sunlight or fumes of petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. Remember to check the containers periodically to ensure that the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. If the containers have cracked or are leaking, replace them.            7.   How often should I change my stored water?     To ensure freshness, your emergency drinking water supply should be changed every six months if you are using tap water.\t\t\t         8.   I've used up my emergency water supply. Now what?     Several other sources of drinking water exist in your home. They include:  \u2022   Water drained from your water heater.  \u2022   Water from the flush tank, not bowl, of your toilet. Purify this water before using it.  Do not use chemically treated or \u201cblue\u201d water. \u2022   Melted ice cubes. \u2022   Liquids from canned fruits and vegetables.           9.   ACWD has issued a \"boil water notice.\" What does this mean?    During an emergency, such as a major earthquake, ACWD may issue a \"boil water notice\" until we can verify that the drinking water in our system is not contaminated and is safe to drink. Boiling water before use kills bacteria and other organisms that may be present as a result of damage to ACWD\u2019s water distribution system. During a \"boil water notice,\" any tap water used for drinking or food preparation must be boiled at a full rolling boil for at least one full minute. A full rolling boil is a vigorous boil that cannot be stopped by stirring the water. If the water is very discolored and/or has visible particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before boiling.           10.   Can I purify my water with household bleach?       Boiling water is the preferred method to kill any potential bacteria and other organisms in the water.  However, if the emergency has left you with no way to boil the water or if you have limited fuel and do not want to use it for boiling water, you may treat the water with fresh liquid chlorine laundry bleach. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous.  Also, be aware that liquid bleach loses strength with age. If the water is very dirty looking and/or has particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before treating it. Below is a description of how much liquid bleach to add to each gallon of water: \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to clear water:1/4 teaspoon (8 drops) per gallon \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to cloudy/dirty water:1/2 teaspoon (16 drops) per gallon After you add the bleach, thoroughly mix by stirring or shaking the container. Let the water stand for 30 minutes before using. A slight chlorine odor should be noticeable in the water. If not, add another dosage of bleach and allow the water to stand another 15 minutes before using. The water can also be treated with the use of water purification tablets which can be purchased at most outdoors or sporting goods stores. Follow the directions for use on the package you purchase. Treat only enough water to meet your needs for 48 hours at a time. There is an increased chance of re-contamination if the treated water sits for more than 48 hours. Refrigeration will also help avoid re-contamination. Note: Most home water filters are meant for water that is already micro-biologically safe. Using these filters during a \"boil water notice\" will not guarantee the safety of the water. Replace any filter cartridges after the boil water notice has been lifted to insure your filter is not contaminated.\t\t\t         11.   Are there any other important drinking water guidelines I should follow after a major earthquake?    It's always best to play it safe when it comes to your drinking water following a disaster. Please keep the following \"water-wise\" tips in mind when considering your source and supply of emergency drinking water.   \u2022   Even if you haven't received word of a \"boil water notice\" after a disaster, if your tap water seems cloudy or has an unpleasant odor, purify it before drinking or do not drink it at all.   \u2022   Conserve your drinking water, even if your supply is not interrupted.  Help by shutting off automatic sprinkler systems. \u2022   If plumbing fixtures in your house are damaged and/or leaking, turn off the water supply to your house at the main shut-off valve.  This valve is typically located in a meter box near the sidewalk/street. \u2022   Immediately after a major disaster, consider closing the main household water shut-off valve to isolate your water supply.  This could prevent contamination of internal plumbing and your water heater.   \u2022   If your water service is interrupted, shut off automatic sprinkler systems and turn off the water heater.\t\t\t                       Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

This will ensure that any residual metals have been flushed from the home plumbing and that you are getting chlorinated water from the main.   2.  Add \u00bc teaspoon (8 drops) of chlorine bleach for each gallon the container holds. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous. 3.  Fill the container with tap water leaving as little headspace as possible. 4.  Cap the container and tape the lid to keep out dust and dirt. 5.  Place the container in a black garbage bag and close.  This controls dust and prevents algal growth. 6.  Mark the date you filled the bottle on a piece of tape and attach it to the bag. This will allow you to know when it's time to change the water you have stored. The filled water containers should be stored in a cool, dark place and should not be exposed to sunlight or fumes of petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. Remember to check the containers periodically to ensure that the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. If the containers have cracked or are leaking, replace them.            7.   How often should I change my stored water?     To ensure freshness, your emergency drinking water supply should be changed every six months if you are using tap water.\t\t\t         8.   I've used up my emergency water supply. Now what?     Several other sources of drinking water exist in your home. They include:  \u2022   Water drained from your water heater.  \u2022   Water from the flush tank, not bowl, of your toilet. Purify this water before using it.  Do not use chemically treated or \u201cblue\u201d water. \u2022   Melted ice cubes. \u2022   Liquids from canned fruits and vegetables.           9.   ACWD has issued a \"boil water notice.\" What does this mean?    During an emergency, such as a major earthquake, ACWD may issue a \"boil water notice\" until we can verify that the drinking water in our system is not contaminated and is safe to drink. Boiling water before use kills bacteria and other organisms that may be present as a result of damage to ACWD\u2019s water distribution system. During a \"boil water notice,\" any tap water used for drinking or food preparation must be boiled at a full rolling boil for at least one full minute. A full rolling boil is a vigorous boil that cannot be stopped by stirring the water. If the water is very discolored and/or has visible particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before boiling.           10.   Can I purify my water with household bleach?       Boiling water is the preferred method to kill any potential bacteria and other organisms in the water.  However, if the emergency has left you with no way to boil the water or if you have limited fuel and do not want to use it for boiling water, you may treat the water with fresh liquid chlorine laundry bleach. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous.  Also, be aware that liquid bleach loses strength with age. If the water is very dirty looking and/or has particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before treating it. Below is a description of how much liquid bleach to add to each gallon of water: \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to clear water:1/4 teaspoon (8 drops) per gallon \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to cloudy/dirty water:1/2 teaspoon (16 drops) per gallon After you add the bleach, thoroughly mix by stirring or shaking the container. Let the water stand for 30 minutes before using. A slight chlorine odor should be noticeable in the water. If not, add another dosage of bleach and allow the water to stand another 15 minutes before using. The water can also be treated with the use of water purification tablets which can be purchased at most outdoors or sporting goods stores. Follow the directions for use on the package you purchase. Treat only enough water to meet your needs for 48 hours at a time. There is an increased chance of re-contamination if the treated water sits for more than 48 hours. Refrigeration will also help avoid re-contamination. Note: Most home water filters are meant for water that is already micro-biologically safe. Using these filters during a \"boil water notice\" will not guarantee the safety of the water. Replace any filter cartridges after the boil water notice has been lifted to insure your filter is not contaminated.\t\t\t         11.   Are there any other important drinking water guidelines I should follow after a major earthquake?    It's always best to play it safe when it comes to your drinking water following a disaster. Please keep the following \"water-wise\" tips in mind when considering your source and supply of emergency drinking water.   \u2022   Even if you haven't received word of a \"boil water notice\" after a disaster, if your tap water seems cloudy or has an unpleasant odor, purify it before drinking or do not drink it at all.   \u2022   Conserve your drinking water, even if your supply is not interrupted.  Help by shutting off automatic sprinkler systems. \u2022   If plumbing fixtures in your house are damaged and/or leaking, turn off the water supply to your house at the main shut-off valve.  This valve is typically located in a meter box near the sidewalk/street. \u2022   Immediately after a major disaster, consider closing the main household water shut-off valve to isolate your water supply.  This could prevent contamination of internal plumbing and your water heater.   \u2022   If your water service is interrupted, shut off automatic sprinkler systems and turn off the water heater.\t\t\t                       Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

In the summer, water deeply and infrequently to encourage deep roots. Turn your sprinkler system down in the fall, and off in the winter. Water landscaping no more than three days per week, if a water shortage emergency ordinance is in effect it may specify less days per week. Use a cycle and soak method to prevent runoff: run the sprinkler for shorter intervals 2-3 times during the day instead of one long period. Adjust sprinklers to avoid watering the sidewalk or driveway. Install drip irrigation for shrubs, trees and gardens. Use mulch to retain soil moisture. Reduce lawn areas and choose native and drought tolerant plants for your landscape. Check out ACWD's  sprinkler system checklist. These tips and more are summarized on ACWD's  Survival Tips For Your Landscaping  flyer. Consider re-using water from around the home to water landscape, such as warm up water from your shower, or consider installing a laundry to landscape system which uses graywater from your clothes washer to irrigate landscaping. Lightly used household water from clothes washing machines, showers, bathroom tubs, and bathroom sinks is also known as graywater. Check out\u00a0 ACWD's Graywater Frequently Asked Questions.

As the area grew and changed from being an important agricultural center to supporting a growing suburban population, our water system has had to adapt. ACWD recognizes the importance of water use efficiency and this demonstration garden is an example of how ACWD uses water wisely at its office locations and operating facilities. It is also a great resource for customers interested in water-efficient gardening techniques. The Demonstration Garden was originally installed in 1980 to showcase water-efficient landscaping to customers after a severe drought. It was so successful that in 1991 the garden was expanded. In 2013, the garden was in need of an update to increase plant diversity and add more features. The renovation was completed in 2017 with a grant from ReScape. Thank you ReScape!

Store at least two gallons of water per person per day, and prepare for a minimum of 3 to 7 days.  For a family of four, this is at least 24 to 56 gallons.  If you have any pets, be sure to store water for them too.  \t\t\t         2.   Is bottled water from the grocery store suitable for storing?     Yes. Bottled water you buy at the grocery store in sealed containers can typically be stored for several years. The bottles should be kept in a cool dark place and should not be exposed to direct sunlight or fumes from petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. You should check the bottles periodically to be sure the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. Replace the bottled water when it reaches the expiration or \u201cuse by\u201d date or if you think the bottles have leaked or lost water due to evaporation.\t\t\t         3.   More Water For Emergencies FAQs    .\t\t\t         4.   Is it safe to store tap water for use during emergencies?     ACWD tap water can be stored safety as long as you take the proper steps to sterilize the storage containers and treat the water before putting it in storage.\t\t\t         5.   What type of container should I use to store the water?     Any clean, airtight container will work, but sturdy, opaque plastic bottles with screw-on caps are preferable. Avoid glass containers that will break easily or paper containers (such as milk cartons) that will weaken over time. Make sure the container has been cleaned with hot, soapy water and rinsed well before filling.\t\t\t         6.   How do I treat the tap water I am planning to store?     Follow the steps below to properly treat the tap water you are storing for emergency use. 1.  Flush the tap for one minute.  This will ensure that any residual metals have been flushed from the home plumbing and that you are getting chlorinated water from the main.   2.  Add \u00bc teaspoon (8 drops) of chlorine bleach for each gallon the container holds. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous. 3.  Fill the container with tap water leaving as little headspace as possible. 4.  Cap the container and tape the lid to keep out dust and dirt. 5.  Place the container in a black garbage bag and close.  This controls dust and prevents algal growth. 6.  Mark the date you filled the bottle on a piece of tape and attach it to the bag. This will allow you to know when it's time to change the water you have stored. The filled water containers should be stored in a cool, dark place and should not be exposed to sunlight or fumes of petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. Remember to check the containers periodically to ensure that the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. If the containers have cracked or are leaking, replace them.            7.   How often should I change my stored water?     To ensure freshness, your emergency drinking water supply should be changed every six months if you are using tap water.\t\t\t         8.   I've used up my emergency water supply. Now what?     Several other sources of drinking water exist in your home. They include:  \u2022   Water drained from your water heater.  \u2022   Water from the flush tank, not bowl, of your toilet. Purify this water before using it.  Do not use chemically treated or \u201cblue\u201d water. \u2022   Melted ice cubes. \u2022   Liquids from canned fruits and vegetables.           9.   ACWD has issued a \"boil water notice.\" What does this mean?    During an emergency, such as a major earthquake, ACWD may issue a \"boil water notice\" until we can verify that the drinking water in our system is not contaminated and is safe to drink. Boiling water before use kills bacteria and other organisms that may be present as a result of damage to ACWD\u2019s water distribution system. During a \"boil water notice,\" any tap water used for drinking or food preparation must be boiled at a full rolling boil for at least one full minute. A full rolling boil is a vigorous boil that cannot be stopped by stirring the water. If the water is very discolored and/or has visible particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before boiling.           10.   Can I purify my water with household bleach?       Boiling water is the preferred method to kill any potential bacteria and other organisms in the water.  However, if the emergency has left you with no way to boil the water or if you have limited fuel and do not want to use it for boiling water, you may treat the water with fresh liquid chlorine laundry bleach. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous.  Also, be aware that liquid bleach loses strength with age. If the water is very dirty looking and/or has particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before treating it. Below is a description of how much liquid bleach to add to each gallon of water: \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to clear water:1/4 teaspoon (8 drops) per gallon \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to cloudy/dirty water:1/2 teaspoon (16 drops) per gallon After you add the bleach, thoroughly mix by stirring or shaking the container. Let the water stand for 30 minutes before using. A slight chlorine odor should be noticeable in the water. If not, add another dosage of bleach and allow the water to stand another 15 minutes before using. The water can also be treated with the use of water purification tablets which can be purchased at most outdoors or sporting goods stores. Follow the directions for use on the package you purchase. Treat only enough water to meet your needs for 48 hours at a time. There is an increased chance of re-contamination if the treated water sits for more than 48 hours. Refrigeration will also help avoid re-contamination. Note: Most home water filters are meant for water that is already micro-biologically safe. Using these filters during a \"boil water notice\" will not guarantee the safety of the water. Replace any filter cartridges after the boil water notice has been lifted to insure your filter is not contaminated.\t\t\t         11.   Are there any other important drinking water guidelines I should follow after a major earthquake?    It's always best to play it safe when it comes to your drinking water following a disaster. Please keep the following \"water-wise\" tips in mind when considering your source and supply of emergency drinking water.   \u2022   Even if you haven't received word of a \"boil water notice\" after a disaster, if your tap water seems cloudy or has an unpleasant odor, purify it before drinking or do not drink it at all.   \u2022   Conserve your drinking water, even if your supply is not interrupted.  Help by shutting off automatic sprinkler systems. \u2022   If plumbing fixtures in your house are damaged and/or leaking, turn off the water supply to your house at the main shut-off valve.  This valve is typically located in a meter box near the sidewalk/street. \u2022   Immediately after a major disaster, consider closing the main household water shut-off valve to isolate your water supply.  This could prevent contamination of internal plumbing and your water heater.   \u2022   If your water service is interrupted, shut off automatic sprinkler systems and turn off the water heater.\t\t\t                       Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

How much water should I store?     Store at least two gallons of water per person per day, and prepare for a minimum of 3 to 7 days.  For a family of four, this is at least 24 to 56 gallons.  If you have any pets, be sure to store water for them too.  \t\t\t         2.   Is bottled water from the grocery store suitable for storing?     Yes. Bottled water you buy at the grocery store in sealed containers can typically be stored for several years. The bottles should be kept in a cool dark place and should not be exposed to direct sunlight or fumes from petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. You should check the bottles periodically to be sure the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. Replace the bottled water when it reaches the expiration or \u201cuse by\u201d date or if you think the bottles have leaked or lost water due to evaporation.\t\t\t         3.   More Water For Emergencies FAQs    .\t\t\t         4.   Is it safe to store tap water for use during emergencies?     ACWD tap water can be stored safety as long as you take the proper steps to sterilize the storage containers and treat the water before putting it in storage.\t\t\t         5.   What type of container should I use to store the water?     Any clean, airtight container will work, but sturdy, opaque plastic bottles with screw-on caps are preferable. Avoid glass containers that will break easily or paper containers (such as milk cartons) that will weaken over time. Make sure the container has been cleaned with hot, soapy water and rinsed well before filling.\t\t\t         6.   How do I treat the tap water I am planning to store?     Follow the steps below to properly treat the tap water you are storing for emergency use. 1.  Flush the tap for one minute.  This will ensure that any residual metals have been flushed from the home plumbing and that you are getting chlorinated water from the main.   2.  Add \u00bc teaspoon (8 drops) of chlorine bleach for each gallon the container holds. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous. 3.  Fill the container with tap water leaving as little headspace as possible. 4.  Cap the container and tape the lid to keep out dust and dirt. 5.  Place the container in a black garbage bag and close.  This controls dust and prevents algal growth. 6.  Mark the date you filled the bottle on a piece of tape and attach it to the bag. This will allow you to know when it's time to change the water you have stored. The filled water containers should be stored in a cool, dark place and should not be exposed to sunlight or fumes of petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides.

Home About Us Water Conservation Conservation at Home Water Saving Tips                         Water Saving Tips\t\t               Indoors Find and fix leaks : If you suspect that you have a leak, ACWD can help. We can explain how to do a leak check at the meter, or provide a \"How to Read Your Water Meter\"  brochure  that describes the leak check process. Finding and fixing leaks is the number one thing you can do to save water and money. In the bathroom : Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth, washing your hands, and shaving. Take shorter showers. Install water saving devices such as low flow shower heads and faucet aerators. Replace old toilets with newer, water efficient models. In the kitchen : Run your dishwasher only when you have full loads. Install a low flow faucet aerator. In the laundry room : Run your clothes washer only when you have a full load. Install a high efficiency clothes washer. Outdoors In the garden: Water in the early morning before the sun is overhead. Water your landscaping no more than three days per week in the summer. Water deeply and infrequently to encourage deep roots. Turn your sprinkler system down in the fall, and off in the winter. Use a cycle and soak method to prevent runoff, in other words, run the sprinkler for shorter intervals 2-3 times during the day instead of one long period. Adjust sprinklers to avoid watering the sidewalk or driveway. Install drip irrigation for shrubs, trees and gardens. Use mulch to retain soil moisture. Reduce lawn areas and choose native and  drought tolerant plants  for your landscape. Outside:  Use a shut-off nozzle on your hose. When cleaning your sidewalk or driveway, use a broom instead of a hose. Get your car washed at a commercial car wash that recycles water.

How much water should I store?     Store at least two gallons of water per person per day, and prepare for a minimum of 3 to 7 days.  For a family of four, this is at least 24 to 56 gallons.  If you have any pets, be sure to store water for them too.  \t\t\t         2.   Is bottled water from the grocery store suitable for storing?     Yes. Bottled water you buy at the grocery store in sealed containers can typically be stored for several years. The bottles should be kept in a cool dark place and should not be exposed to direct sunlight or fumes from petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. You should check the bottles periodically to be sure the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. Replace the bottled water when it reaches the expiration or \u201cuse by\u201d date or if you think the bottles have leaked or lost water due to evaporation.\t\t\t         3.   More Water For Emergencies FAQs    .\t\t\t         4.   Is it safe to store tap water for use during emergencies?     ACWD tap water can be stored safety as long as you take the proper steps to sterilize the storage containers and treat the water before putting it in storage.\t\t\t         5.   What type of container should I use to store the water?     Any clean, airtight container will work, but sturdy, opaque plastic bottles with screw-on caps are preferable. Avoid glass containers that will break easily or paper containers (such as milk cartons) that will weaken over time. Make sure the container has been cleaned with hot, soapy water and rinsed well before filling.\t\t\t         6.   How do I treat the tap water I am planning to store?     Follow the steps below to properly treat the tap water you are storing for emergency use. 1.  Flush the tap for one minute.  This will ensure that any residual metals have been flushed from the home plumbing and that you are getting chlorinated water from the main.   2.  Add \u00bc teaspoon (8 drops) of chlorine bleach for each gallon the container holds. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous. 3.  Fill the container with tap water leaving as little headspace as possible. 4.  Cap the container and tape the lid to keep out dust and dirt. 5.  Place the container in a black garbage bag and close.  This controls dust and prevents algal growth. 6.  Mark the date you filled the bottle on a piece of tape and attach it to the bag. This will allow you to know when it's time to change the water you have stored. The filled water containers should be stored in a cool, dark place and should not be exposed to sunlight or fumes of petroleum products and pesticides/herbicides. Remember to check the containers periodically to ensure that the plastic has not cracked or developed leaks. If the containers have cracked or are leaking, replace them.            7.   How often should I change my stored water?     To ensure freshness, your emergency drinking water supply should be changed every six months if you are using tap water.\t\t\t         8.   I've used up my emergency water supply. Now what?     Several other sources of drinking water exist in your home. They include:  \u2022   Water drained from your water heater.  \u2022   Water from the flush tank, not bowl, of your toilet. Purify this water before using it.  Do not use chemically treated or \u201cblue\u201d water. \u2022   Melted ice cubes. \u2022   Liquids from canned fruits and vegetables.           9.   ACWD has issued a \"boil water notice.\" What does this mean?    During an emergency, such as a major earthquake, ACWD may issue a \"boil water notice\" until we can verify that the drinking water in our system is not contaminated and is safe to drink. Boiling water before use kills bacteria and other organisms that may be present as a result of damage to ACWD\u2019s water distribution system. During a \"boil water notice,\" any tap water used for drinking or food preparation must be boiled at a full rolling boil for at least one full minute. A full rolling boil is a vigorous boil that cannot be stopped by stirring the water. If the water is very discolored and/or has visible particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before boiling.           10.   Can I purify my water with household bleach?       Boiling water is the preferred method to kill any potential bacteria and other organisms in the water.  However, if the emergency has left you with no way to boil the water or if you have limited fuel and do not want to use it for boiling water, you may treat the water with fresh liquid chlorine laundry bleach. NOTE: do not use scented, color safe, laundry bleach, powdered bleach, or swimming pool chlorine - these contain additional chemicals that are poisonous.  Also, be aware that liquid bleach loses strength with age. If the water is very dirty looking and/or has particulate matter in it, you should filter the water through a coffee filter, paper towels, or clean cloth before treating it. Below is a description of how much liquid bleach to add to each gallon of water: \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to clear water:1/4 teaspoon (8 drops) per gallon \u2022   Amount of fresh bleach to add to cloudy/dirty water:1/2 teaspoon (16 drops) per gallon After you add the bleach, thoroughly mix by stirring or shaking the container. Let the water stand for 30 minutes before using. A slight chlorine odor should be noticeable in the water. If not, add another dosage of bleach and allow the water to stand another 15 minutes before using. The water can also be treated with the use of water purification tablets which can be purchased at most outdoors or sporting goods stores. Follow the directions for use on the package you purchase. Treat only enough water to meet your needs for 48 hours at a time. There is an increased chance of re-contamination if the treated water sits for more than 48 hours. Refrigeration will also help avoid re-contamination. Note: Most home water filters are meant for water that is already micro-biologically safe. Using these filters during a \"boil water notice\" will not guarantee the safety of the water. Replace any filter cartridges after the boil water notice has been lifted to insure your filter is not contaminated.\t\t\t         11.   Are there any other important drinking water guidelines I should follow after a major earthquake?    It's always best to play it safe when it comes to your drinking water following a disaster. Please keep the following \"water-wise\" tips in mind when considering your source and supply of emergency drinking water.   \u2022   Even if you haven't received word of a \"boil water notice\" after a disaster, if your tap water seems cloudy or has an unpleasant odor, purify it before drinking or do not drink it at all.   \u2022   Conserve your drinking water, even if your supply is not interrupted.  Help by shutting off automatic sprinkler systems. \u2022   If plumbing fixtures in your house are damaged and/or leaking, turn off the water supply to your house at the main shut-off valve.  This valve is typically located in a meter box near the sidewalk/street. \u2022   Immediately after a major disaster, consider closing the main household water shut-off valve to isolate your water supply.  This could prevent contamination of internal plumbing and your water heater.   \u2022   If your water service is interrupted, shut off automatic sprinkler systems and turn off the water heater.\t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Believed to be the first fishing weight exchange program of this kind on the West Coast, the program has already received great support from local anglers. This program was conceived and facilitated by ACWD and is fully supported by EBRPD. Practicing and promoting good environmental stewardship is an important component of each agency's core mission. Concerns regarding lead toxicity in the environment prompted ACWD to evaluate the potential adverse impacts of lead fishing weights at the Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area. A  news article  featured the program as it reached a milestone - more than 1,000 pounds of lead have been collected at Quarry Lakes. Why a Program is Necessary Lead is toxic to animals and humans when ingested. Birds are particularly susceptible to ingesting lead fishing tackle lost by anglers. Some birds may eat the lead weights which they mistake as snails. Other waterfowl, searching for material to swallow to help grind their food, may mistake lead weights for small pebbles. Once ingested, acid in a bird's stomach or gizzard dissolves the lead, which then enters its bloodstream and is carried to vital organs. Health impacts can range from loss of weight to the inability to fly or walk, and may even result in death. Predators and scavengers who then eat these birds are also at risk for lead poisoning. In addition, since the water in the Quarry Lakes filters down into the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin where it becomes an important water supply for the Tri-City area, any lead in the water might eventually find its way to the tap. Fortunately, there are inexpensive and ecologically friendly alternatives to lead fishing tackle. Tin, steel, bismuth, glass, ceramic, rubber, and plastic all work just as well as lead and are not harmful to you or waterfowl. Public Awareness To explain the hazards of using lead fishing tackle, ACWD created the  Quarry Lakes Lead Fishing Tackle Awareness Brochure . It is distributed to all Quarry Lakes anglers who purchase a fishing permit and is made available in several brochure racks around the Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area. \u00a0The Lead Fishing Weight Exchange Program The Quarry Lakes Lead Fishing Weight Exchange Program gives anglers the opportunity to trade-in their lead split-shot weights and sinkers for lead-free split-shot weights and sinkers. This one-for-one trade is provided at no cost to the angler. The exchange program is operated by EBRPD staff from the Quarry Lakes entrance kiosk when time permits. On one Saturday each month during peak fishing season (September through May), a Lead Fishing Weight Exchange booth is set up and operated by volunteers. The schedule for exchange events is listed below. Once an angler has exchanged their lead weights, they are encouraged to purchase lead-free fishing tackle in the future. How the Exchange Works If you plan to fish at Quarry Lakes, please remember that lead tackle is prohibited. If you would like to trade-in your lead split-shot weights and sinkers for lead-free alternatives, here's how the exchange program works: Lead weights will be exchanged for the available lead-free alternative that approximates the same shape and/or weight. This is a one-for-one trade provided at no cost to the angler. Limit of 15 lead weight exchanges per day (limit subject to change). Lead-free tackle is not intended for resale. Lead Fishing Weight Exchange Schedule Lead fishing weight exchanges can be made out of the Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area kiosk when time permits. Please contact EBRPD at (510) 544-3130 to obtain dates and times of special Exchange events.

Home About Us News & Information Special Projects & Programs Invasive Mussels                         Invasive Mussels\t\t               ACWD would like to\u00a0 remind boaters to do their part to help thwart invasive quagga and zebra mussels. Boats are the primary transporters of these species and boaters should take special care to properly clean, drain, and dry their vessels. Threats Non-native quagga and zebra mussels threaten California in a variety of ways:\u00a0 They wreak havoc on the environment by disrupting the natural food chain and releasing toxins that affect other aquatic species. They can colonize on hulls, engines, and steering components of boats and can damage boat motors and restrict cooling. They frequently settle in massive colonies that can block water intake structures and threaten municipal water supplies, agricultural irrigation, and power plant operations. They reproduce quickly and in large number and are extremely difficult to eradicate. E fforts are currently underway to implement a region-wide strategy to prevent the spread of these mussels to local water bodies. As a part of this effort, ACWD has become an active member of the Bay Area Regional Consortium for Mussel Prevention. Boat inspections at many of the lakes and reservoirs you may visit, including Quarry Lakes, are an important part of this strategy. Preventing the spread of mussels is essential to protecting ACWD\u2019s water delivery infrastructure and avoiding the significant costs ACWD customers would have to bear in the event of a mussel infestation. What You Can Do Quagga and zebra mussels move from one place to another primarily through human-related activities. They attach to hard surfaces, including boats and fishing gear, and can survive out of water for up to a week. The microscopic larvae can be transported in bait buckets, bilges, ballast water, or other equipment that holds water. To prevent the spread of mussels, follow these steps: When removing your boat from the water: - Inspect all exposed surfaces \u2013 small mussels feel like sandpaper to the touch. - Wash the hull of each watercraft thoroughly. - Remove all plant and animal material. - Drain all water and dry all areas. - Drain and dry the lower outboard unit. - Clean and dry all live-wells. - Empty and dry any buckets. - Dispose of all bait in the trash. - Wait five days in hot weather, and up to 30 days in cool and moist weather, before launching into different fresh waters. - Keep watercraft dry between launches into different fresh waters. Do not put your boat into waters that are inhabited or at high risk of inhabitation. These areas include: Lake Mead, Lake Havasu, Lake Mojave, Lake Skinner, Copper Basin Reservoir, San Justo Reservoir, and generally waters of San Benito County and California counties south of the Tehachapi Mountains, and any waters outside of California. Maintain a clean and dry boat inside and out! This includes all bilges, tanks, water pipes, trailers and accessories. Allow extra time when you visit local lakes and reservoirs to allow for staff to inspect all boats for invasive species and standing water. Remember that boats failing inspection may be turned away.

Hill Water Agency Award for Excellence The Alameda\u00a0 County Water District has been awarded the prestigious Clair A. Hill Water Agency Award for Excellence from the Association of California Water Agencies for ACWD\u2019s Alameda Creek Fish Passage Improvements Program. \u00a0 The award-winning program is comprised of seven fish passage and water supply projects constructed over two decades along Alameda Creek in Fremont. Meeting the challenge of addressing fish migration and water supply woes, the program and its two innovative fish ladders open up Lower Alameda Creek, allowing migratory fish to bypass obstacles in place since the early 1970s.\u00a0 As a Clair A. Hill Award recipient, ACWD also receives a $5,000 scholarship to be awarded to a deserving student the following year. \u00a0 Creating a More Fish-Friendly Waterway In an effort to restore steelhead trout to Alameda Creek, ACWD and a number of Bay Area agencies have worked for more than a decade to make the creek a more fish-friendly waterway. To improve fish passage through the Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel, ACWD's fish passage projects at its water supply facilities include: the removal of one rubber dam; construction of fish ladders at two rubber dams; and the installation of fishscreens at off-stream diversions. All construction projects are slated for completion by late 2021.

Steelhead trout are anadromous fish, living out their adult lives in the ocean and migrating up fresh water streams and rivers to spawn and rear their young. Modifications to the Alameda Creek streambed and urbanization of the surrounding land, however, eliminated spawning areas and made it impossible for steelhead to migrate upstream. As a result, steelhead have been absent from Alameda Creek and its tributaries for several decades. ACWD Fundraising ACWD received $2.1 million from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF), and the Department of Water Resources (DWR) to initiate four projects to improve steelhead migration in Alameda Creek. Through the 2005 San Francisco Bay Salmonid Habitat Restoration Fund, NFWF and DWR have helped to fund other projects that will benefit salmon and steelhead trout in central and southern San Francisco Bay watersheds. ACWD's projects are part of a much larger effort to restore steelhead in the Alameda Creek watershed. The San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, Zone 7 Water Agency, East Bay Regional Park District, and Alameda County Public Works Agency are all involved in projects that will make Alameda Creek a more fish-friendly waterway.

However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0                 \u25bc  Drought Resource Center - 2023\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   Does ACWD have enough water?     Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years. More significantly, these recent dry years exhibit characteristics of changed precipitation patterns that are anticipated to occur with climate change \u2013 notably a shorter rainy season and a longer dry season. ACWD is working with water resources managers throughout the state to study and prepare for climate change and develop adaption plans for the new weather patterns; the challenges of today\u2019s drought form a learning opportunity for better management tomorrow \u2013 a silver lining!           3.   How do I take care of my trees?     After several critically dry years, it is important to conserve now to save water for the future. However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area.

I\u2019m already saving water. What more can I do to conserve?      Thank you for your efforts to conserve! Although ACWD is no longer experiencing a water shortage emergency, with California\u2019s climate and increasing effects of climate change, every bit of conservation helps, so please continue to reduce. There are simple changes that all Californians can do to save water and ACWD offers a comprehensive suite of water use efficiency measures, such as rebates, technical assistance, and education programs to help. Each one of us can make a difference \u2013 working together as one community to make conservation a way of life in California. \u00a0 \u00a0           5.   How long will the water shortage emergency last and restrictions remain in place?     ACWD's water shortage emergency has been lifted and water use restrictions are no longer in effect.           6.   What is best practice for irrigating my lawn?      ACWD prohibits irrigation runoff so we recommend using a cycle and soak method when irrigating to avoid runoff. A cycle and soak method uses shorter, more frequent cycles of irrigation in one day versus one long runtime. To determine the time you should water for a cycle and soak method, run your irrigation system until you start to see signs of runoff (e.g. water overflowing from landscape onto sidewalk). Then, turn off your irrigation and let the landscape soak for 1 hour and repeat the process 2-3 times. Note the time it takes to begin seeing runoff \u2013 anything applied beyond this time during a single watering event is wasted.\u00a0           7.   I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     If you witness water waste, you can report it to ACWD by completing our Water Waste Reporting Form at  acwd.org/reportwaste  or by calling our Water Use Efficiency team at 510.668.4218. For water emergencies, such as a broken main or fire hydrant, please contact our 24-hour emergency hotline at 510.668.6500.           8.   What is the ban on non-functional turf for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers passed by the State of California?     On June 10, 2022, the State of California\u2019s emergency regulation for urban water conservation prohibiting irrigation of non-functional turf at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties went into effect and was readopted for another year on June 5, 2023. This regulation also prohibits irrigation of non-functional turf in common areas of Homeowners Associations (HOAs). It does not apply to residential properties. Check out the  non-functional turf fact sheet  or visit the  State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information, including a list of  frequently asked questions.  Become future-ready and remove grass and non-functional turf now by taking advantage of ACWD\u2019s Lawn Be Gone Rebate Program.  Learn more.           9.   What is \"non-functional\" turf?     The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?     For an extensive list of water efficient tips and techniques for different types of landscape, check out  ACWD\u2019s Survival Tips for Your Landscape resource . See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule. For more questions regarding the rate and fee schedule, contact customer service at (510) 668 \u2013 4200.\u00a0 You can also\u00a0 review the document here.

Does ACWD have enough water?     Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years. More significantly, these recent dry years exhibit characteristics of changed precipitation patterns that are anticipated to occur with climate change \u2013 notably a shorter rainy season and a longer dry season.

How do I take care of my trees?     After several critically dry years, it is important to conserve now to save water for the future. However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0           4.   I\u2019m already saving water. What more can I do to conserve?      Thank you for your efforts to conserve! Although ACWD is no longer experiencing a water shortage emergency, with California\u2019s climate and increasing effects of climate change, every bit of conservation helps, so please continue to reduce. There are simple changes that all Californians can do to save water and ACWD offers a comprehensive suite of water use efficiency measures, such as rebates, technical assistance, and education programs to help. Each one of us can make a difference \u2013 working together as one community to make conservation a way of life in California. \u00a0 \u00a0           5.   How long will the water shortage emergency last and restrictions remain in place?     ACWD's water shortage emergency has been lifted and water use restrictions are no longer in effect.           6.   What is best practice for irrigating my lawn?      ACWD prohibits irrigation runoff so we recommend using a cycle and soak method when irrigating to avoid runoff. A cycle and soak method uses shorter, more frequent cycles of irrigation in one day versus one long runtime. To determine the time you should water for a cycle and soak method, run your irrigation system until you start to see signs of runoff (e.g. water overflowing from landscape onto sidewalk). Then, turn off your irrigation and let the landscape soak for 1 hour and repeat the process 2-3 times. Note the time it takes to begin seeing runoff \u2013 anything applied beyond this time during a single watering event is wasted.\u00a0           7.   I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     If you witness water waste, you can report it to ACWD by completing our Water Waste Reporting Form at  acwd.org/reportwaste  or by calling our Water Use Efficiency team at 510.668.4218. For water emergencies, such as a broken main or fire hydrant, please contact our 24-hour emergency hotline at 510.668.6500.           8.   What is the ban on non-functional turf for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers passed by the State of California?     On June 10, 2022, the State of California\u2019s emergency regulation for urban water conservation prohibiting irrigation of non-functional turf at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties went into effect and was readopted for another year on June 5, 2023. This regulation also prohibits irrigation of non-functional turf in common areas of Homeowners Associations (HOAs). It does not apply to residential properties. Check out the  non-functional turf fact sheet  or visit the  State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information, including a list of  frequently asked questions.  Become future-ready and remove grass and non-functional turf now by taking advantage of ACWD\u2019s Lawn Be Gone Rebate Program.  Learn more.           9.   What is \"non-functional\" turf?     The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?     For an extensive list of water efficient tips and techniques for different types of landscape, check out  ACWD\u2019s Survival Tips for Your Landscape resource . See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule.

Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years. More significantly, these recent dry years exhibit characteristics of changed precipitation patterns that are anticipated to occur with climate change \u2013 notably a shorter rainy season and a longer dry season. ACWD is working with water resources managers throughout the state to study and prepare for climate change and develop adaption plans for the new weather patterns; the challenges of today\u2019s drought form a learning opportunity for better management tomorrow \u2013 a silver lining!           3.   How do I take care of my trees?     After several critically dry years, it is important to conserve now to save water for the future. However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0           4.   I\u2019m already saving water. What more can I do to conserve?      Thank you for your efforts to conserve! Although ACWD is no longer experiencing a water shortage emergency, with California\u2019s climate and increasing effects of climate change, every bit of conservation helps, so please continue to reduce. There are simple changes that all Californians can do to save water and ACWD offers a comprehensive suite of water use efficiency measures, such as rebates, technical assistance, and education programs to help. Each one of us can make a difference \u2013 working together as one community to make conservation a way of life in California. \u00a0 \u00a0           5.   How long will the water shortage emergency last and restrictions remain in place?     ACWD's water shortage emergency has been lifted and water use restrictions are no longer in effect.           6.   What is best practice for irrigating my lawn?      ACWD prohibits irrigation runoff so we recommend using a cycle and soak method when irrigating to avoid runoff. A cycle and soak method uses shorter, more frequent cycles of irrigation in one day versus one long runtime. To determine the time you should water for a cycle and soak method, run your irrigation system until you start to see signs of runoff (e.g. water overflowing from landscape onto sidewalk). Then, turn off your irrigation and let the landscape soak for 1 hour and repeat the process 2-3 times. Note the time it takes to begin seeing runoff \u2013 anything applied beyond this time during a single watering event is wasted.\u00a0           7.   I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     If you witness water waste, you can report it to ACWD by completing our Water Waste Reporting Form at  acwd.org/reportwaste  or by calling our Water Use Efficiency team at 510.668.4218. For water emergencies, such as a broken main or fire hydrant, please contact our 24-hour emergency hotline at 510.668.6500.           8.   What is the ban on non-functional turf for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers passed by the State of California?     On June 10, 2022, the State of California\u2019s emergency regulation for urban water conservation prohibiting irrigation of non-functional turf at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties went into effect and was readopted for another year on June 5, 2023. This regulation also prohibits irrigation of non-functional turf in common areas of Homeowners Associations (HOAs). It does not apply to residential properties. Check out the  non-functional turf fact sheet  or visit the  State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information, including a list of  frequently asked questions.  Become future-ready and remove grass and non-functional turf now by taking advantage of ACWD\u2019s Lawn Be Gone Rebate Program.  Learn more.           9.   What is \"non-functional\" turf?     The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?     For an extensive list of water efficient tips and techniques for different types of landscape, check out  ACWD\u2019s Survival Tips for Your Landscape resource . See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule.

Does ACWD have enough water?     Water Years 2020, 2021, and 2022 were critically dry years for the Tri-City area, but Water Year 2023 saw extreme local and statewide precipitation. As a result, ACWD\u2019s water supplies have improved and the groundwater basin has returned to healthy levels. As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in this unprecedented weather and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. To do that, we need to make strategic water resources investments while also improving water use efficiency. Together we must be prepared and more drought-ready.           2.   Is drought a result of climate change?      California is no stranger to drought, but 2013-2014 and 2020-2022 are two of California\u2019s driest periods in 150 years. More significantly, these recent dry years exhibit characteristics of changed precipitation patterns that are anticipated to occur with climate change \u2013 notably a shorter rainy season and a longer dry season. ACWD is working with water resources managers throughout the state to study and prepare for climate change and develop adaption plans for the new weather patterns; the challenges of today\u2019s drought form a learning opportunity for better management tomorrow \u2013 a silver lining!           3.   How do I take care of my trees?     After several critically dry years, it is important to conserve now to save water for the future. However, it is important to care for trees so that they survive through the drought and beyond due to the multiple benefits they provide communities, such as improved air quality. Customers are encouraged to prioritize water for trees. Watering trees gradually but deeply will ensure they survive. Trees are most efficiently watered by hand or using a bubbler or drip irrigation system, and should be on a separate valve than the surrounding vegetation, especially if planted in a lawn area. The frequency and amount of water needed will depend on whether the tree is young and needs to be established or if it is mature, and whether it is a low, medium, or high water use species. Please add a layer of mulch around the root zone of the tree carefully avoiding the base of the trunk to lower soil temperatures and reduce the amount of water that evaporates. \u00a0Resources with specific tips on how to care for and water your tree efficiently: Canopy Tree Watering Guidelines for Your Specific Type of Tree Canopy Tips for Caring for Young Trees \u00a0 Canopy Tree Library for Choosing the Right Tree to Install ACWD Water Conservation Tips for Your Landscape Save Our Trees Website Save Our Water \u2013 Helping Your Trees Survive the Drought \u00a0           4.   I\u2019m already saving water. What more can I do to conserve?      Thank you for your efforts to conserve! Although ACWD is no longer experiencing a water shortage emergency, with California\u2019s climate and increasing effects of climate change, every bit of conservation helps, so please continue to reduce. There are simple changes that all Californians can do to save water and ACWD offers a comprehensive suite of water use efficiency measures, such as rebates, technical assistance, and education programs to help. Each one of us can make a difference \u2013 working together as one community to make conservation a way of life in California. \u00a0 \u00a0           5.   How long will the water shortage emergency last and restrictions remain in place?     ACWD's water shortage emergency has been lifted and water use restrictions are no longer in effect.           6.   What is best practice for irrigating my lawn?      ACWD prohibits irrigation runoff so we recommend using a cycle and soak method when irrigating to avoid runoff. A cycle and soak method uses shorter, more frequent cycles of irrigation in one day versus one long runtime. To determine the time you should water for a cycle and soak method, run your irrigation system until you start to see signs of runoff (e.g. water overflowing from landscape onto sidewalk). Then, turn off your irrigation and let the landscape soak for 1 hour and repeat the process 2-3 times. Note the time it takes to begin seeing runoff \u2013 anything applied beyond this time during a single watering event is wasted.\u00a0           7.   I have noticed water waste occurring in my neighborhood, at work, etc. How do I report it?     If you witness water waste, you can report it to ACWD by completing our Water Waste Reporting Form at  acwd.org/reportwaste  or by calling our Water Use Efficiency team at 510.668.4218. For water emergencies, such as a broken main or fire hydrant, please contact our 24-hour emergency hotline at 510.668.6500.           8.   What is the ban on non-functional turf for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers passed by the State of California?     On June 10, 2022, the State of California\u2019s emergency regulation for urban water conservation prohibiting irrigation of non-functional turf at commercial, industrial, and institutional properties went into effect and was readopted for another year on June 5, 2023. This regulation also prohibits irrigation of non-functional turf in common areas of Homeowners Associations (HOAs). It does not apply to residential properties. Check out the  non-functional turf fact sheet  or visit the  State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information, including a list of  frequently asked questions.  Become future-ready and remove grass and non-functional turf now by taking advantage of ACWD\u2019s Lawn Be Gone Rebate Program.  Learn more.           9.   What is \"non-functional\" turf?     The State of California defines non-functional turf as \u201cground cover surface of mowed grass that is ornamental and not otherwise used for human recreation purposes.\u201d Non-functional turf does not include school fields, sports fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional.           10.   How do you determine if turf is considered functional or non-functional?     Non-functional turf refers to areas of turf that are solely ornamental and not used for human recreation purposes. In other words, if the turf serves no purpose other than to look nice, it is considered non-functional. Example of functional turf include sports fields, school fields, and areas regularly used for civic or community events. Examples of non-functional turf may include sidewalk strips or medians in parking lots that are solely for decoration. Properties should review the areas of turf they maintain and determine whether it is functional or not and provide ACWD information regarding which areas are functional at  acwd.org/reportturf.           11.   Are there exemptions to the non-functional turf ban for commercial, industrial, or institutional properties or HOA common areas?     Areas of turf are exempt if: The turf is used for human recreation, civic purposes, sports or play. The turf is irrigated with recycled water. The turf is irrigated with non-potable water (water that is not permitted for use as a drinking water supply). The turf is necessary to ensure the health of trees and other perennial non-turf plantings. The turf is at a residential location, not at a commercial, industrial, or institutional location. The exception to this is common areas in Homeowners Association sites. Unless one of the above exemptions applies, HOA common areas are included in this turf irrigation ban. There is also an exemption process available for certain low water using turf species and irrigation approaches.\u00a0Visit the\u00a0 State Water Resources Control Board website  for more information on what types of plant species apply.\u00a0           12.   What are some recommended actions to reduce water use?     The following indoor and outdoor water conservation measures can help reduce water use. Indoor: Find and repair leaks as soon as possible Replace older, inefficient, and high flow plumbing fixtures (e.g. toilets, showerheads, faucets, clothes washers) with newer, water-efficient models Adopt everyday water conservation practices, such as reducing shower times, running dishwashers and washing machines with full loads only, and turning off the water when brushing teeth, shaving, and washing hands Restaurants should serve water to customers only when requested Hotels should provide guests with the option to not have towels and linens changed and laundered daily Outdoor: Remove lawn and install low water use plants instead Irrigate landscape before 10 a.m. to minimize evaporation Prioritize water for trees and water trees gradually but deeply by hand or using a drip irrigation system Use non-potable water from rainwater capture or water collected from indoor uses (e.g. shower warm up water or water used to rinse vegetables) for landscape irrigation Evaluate irrigation systems to find and repair leaks Wash cars at a commercial car wash that recycles water           13.   What recommendations does ACWD have for landscape irrigation during drought and beyond?     For an extensive list of water efficient tips and techniques for different types of landscape, check out  ACWD\u2019s Survival Tips for Your Landscape resource . See below for some key recommendations: Irrigate early in the morning (before 10:00 a.m.), to minimize evaporation\u00a0 Existing irrigation systems should be evaluated and repaired to minimize leaks and evaporation and increase water use efficiency\u00a0 Water used outdoors should be prioritized for trees\u00a0 Use of drought tolerant plant species wherever possible when replacing or renovating existing landscapes, and at all new landscape installations\u00a0 Use non-potable water from rainwater capture and/or graywater systems for landscape irrigation where possible (do not use in vegetable gardens or consumable plants)\u00a0 Installation of new landscaping should utilize best known irrigation and horticultural practices for efficient water use\u00a0           14.   Do I need to let my lawn dry out during every period of drought?     A well-maintained lawn can withstand a drought year with reduced watering so we ask customers to adjust irrigation schedules to reduce their water use, while helping their lawn establish a stronger root system. Lawns may look stressed with areas of browning, but should remain alive and return when we receive sufficient rainfall and/or restrictions are lifted. \u00a0 Conduct irrigation system checks and repair any leaks or breaks to ensure that your irrigation system is working efficiently. A functioning irrigation system can help your landscape survive during extended dry periods and drought. Better yet, to avoid having your landscape stress and dry out, convert lawns to drought-tolerant landscape. ACWD offers resources and a rebate to help you do so. For more information visit  acwd.org/rebates .           15.   Why is new development and construction allowed during droughts and even during water shortage emergencies?     ACWD is required by law to conduct a Water Supply Assessment for new developments to ensure sufficient supply.\u00a0In addition,\u00a0 ACWD\u2019s Water Shortage Contingency Plan  includes the option to place a moratorium on new development, new water service connections, and expanded services in the case of an extremely critical shortage, unless they are required for health and safety. To date, ACWD has not determined a need to temporarily suspend new water service connections. \u00a0           16.   I am interested in water conservation. What rebates does ACWD offer residential and commercial customers?     For all program information, please visit ACWD\u2019s  rebates page .\u00a0           17.   I want to put in a new lawn; if I do, will there be restrictions on how much I can water it?       As we recover from drought, we are mindful of the role climate change has played in these unprecedented periods of drought and our need to adapt to a new climate future, one in which California will experience more frequent and potentially more severe droughts. One of the first restrictions that are adopted during periods of drought are restrictions on outdoor irrigation (e.g. number of days per week \u00a0irrigation is allowed for functional lawns). You can prepare your landscape and be drought-ready by converting lawns to water-efficient landscape. ACWD encourages customers to install water-efficient landscapes and provides a rebate to customers that replace existing lawns with this type of landscape. There are many benefits to installing water-efficient landscape rather than a new lawn: Water-efficient landscapes are designed to survive dry year conditions and so you can have a thriving landscape year-round and as the climate fluctuates.\u00a0 Water-efficient landscape require significantly less water than a lawn and could reduce your water bill.\u00a0 You may be eligible to receive a rebate if you have a lawn and replace it with a water-efficient landscape. Please visit  acwd.org/rebates  to determine if your lawn qualifies for our water-efficient landscape rebate program or contact the Water Use Efficiency Team at 510-668-4218. If you are an HOA or a commercial, industrial, or institutional customer please see the FAQ: \u201cWhat is the ban on non-functional turf irrigation for commercial, industrial, and institutional customers adopted by the State of California?\u201d           18.   Why doesn't your lawn removal rebate program cover artificial turf or concrete if replacing my lawn with these saves water?      While artificial turf requires less water than a natural turf lawn, there are healthier and more ecologically sound alternatives. In addition to saving water, low water use plants and permeable landscape material meet additional sustainability goals that artificial turf and concrete do not: \u00a0 1) Artificial turf and concrete are not a living landscape and do not increase biodiversity of plant, animal, and insect populations.\u00a0 2) Artificial turf has potential environmental concerns. It is synthetic material that will have to be replaced in 10-20 years due to wear and tear, so it will eventually end up in a landfill.\u00a0 3) Artificial turf is not water free. It needs to be cleaned with water and potentially with chemicals. This raises the concern of chemical pollutants from the cleaning materials, and potentially from the artificial turf itself, polluting surface water and groundwater in the runoff. 4) Artificial turf and concrete can get significantly hotter than surrounding air temperatures and contribute to the heat island effect by increasing air temperatures in urban settings. \u00a0           19.   What is ACWD doing to reduce its water use?     Please visit  ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Efforts webpage  to learn more about how ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely.           20.   Why are some fire hydrants open with water discharging?    ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning.            21.   Why doesn't ACWD recapture the water discharged from fire hydrants in the Main Cleaning Program?     Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it\u2019s just not technically feasible.  In order to clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at very high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The amount of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of these State-required processes. To learn more about the main cleaning program, please visit: www.acwd.org/maincleaning. \t\t\t         22.   Does the State of California offer a lawn removal rebate program I can participate in?     The State of California currently does not offer a lawn removal rebate program. Customers are encouraged to take advantage of the water-efficient landscape rebate program that ACWD offers so that they can save water and money by replacing their water thirsty lawn with a water-efficient landscape.\u00a0 Learn more  about ACWD\u2019s rebate program.\u00a0           23.   Will you be raising your $2/square foot rebate amount for your lawn removal program?      ACWD's Board approved an increase in the rebate amount for the Lawn Be Gone (LBG) rebate from $1/square foot to $2/square foot on June 10, 2021. ACWD is always evaluating enhancements to its water conservation programs to better serve customers in their efforts to conserve water. This may include changes to rebate amounts; however, our Board must first approve this kind of change. Currently, the rebate amount is set at $2/square foot of lawn removed and will remain so for the time being.\u00a0           24.   Does ACWD offer rebates for removal of other types of landscape, like trees to prevent fire risk?      ACWD currently offers a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscape. Lawns tend to be the highest water use landscape, so replacing your lawn with water-efficient landscape will ensure you maximize your water savings.           25.   If my water supply is terminated, how can I restore it?     The customer must have stopped the wasteful use of water and have paid all charges owed to the District under the Ordinance before the District will restore full water service.\u00a0 When water service is returned, t he customer will be charged applicable fees established in the District\u2019s Rate and Fee Schedule.

On May 13, 2021, the ACWD Board of Directors adopted ACWD's 2020-2025 Plan, ACWD's Water Shortage Contingency Plan, and ACWD's Addendum to the 2015-2020 Plan.\u00a0 ACWD appended its 2015-2020 Plan to m eet the requ irements of the Delta Plan Policy WR P1, \u201cReduce Reliance on the Delta Through Improved Regional Water Self-Reliance\u201d (\u201cReduce Reliance on the Delta\u201d; California Code of Regulations, Title 23, section 5003) and is linked here:  ACWD's Addendum to the 2015-2020 Plan (PDF) . ACWD's 2020-2025 Plan also includes the Reduce Reliance on the Delta requirements and Water Shortage Contingency Plan. \u00a0 ACWD has also worked with the California Department of Water Resources to address minor edits to the 2020-2025 Plan and Water Shortage Contingency Plan; these edits were minor and resulted in no substantial changes to these documents. These minor edits and errata sheet were incorporated in the Plan and Water Shortage Contingency Plan Final Versions Including Minor Edits linked below.

What is a Public Health Goal (PHG)?     A PHG is the level of a chemical contaminant in drinking water that does not pose a significant risk to health. \u00a0PHGs are not regulatory standards. \u00a0However, state law requires the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to set drinking water standards for chemical contaminants as close to the corresponding PHG as is economically and technologically feasible. \u00a0In some cases, it may not be feasible for SWRCB to set drinking water standard for a contaminant at the same level as the PHG. \u00a0The technology to treat the chemicals may not be available, or the cost of treatment may be very high. \u00a0SWRCB must consider these factors when developing a drinking water standard. For more information,  view OEHHA's website           2.   What is a Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG)?     Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG) is the level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health. \u00a0MCLGs allow for a margin of safety and are non-enforceable public health goals. For more information,  view EPA's website           3.   What is a Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)?     Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) is the highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water. MCLs are set as close to MCLGs as feasible using the best available treatment technology and taking cost into consideration. \u00a0MCLs are enforceable standards.

Home About Us Customer Service Water Rates                         Water Rates\t\t               Understanding Your Water Bill ACWD bills customers every other month, or six times per year. On these bimonthly bills, a customer is billed both a fixed \"service charge\" and a \"consumption charge\" based on the quantity of water used during the billing period. To learn more about how the District sets water rates and charges, please visit the  Water Rates Process  page. You may also view the full  Schedule of Rates and Fees . Water Shortage Emergency Stage Rates The District declared a Stage 2 water shortage emergency in December 2021, with a 15% systemwide reduction in demand. In order to ensure that the District receives sufficient revenues to cover its cost of providing water service when consumption has decreased, the District has adopted Water Shortage Emergency Stage Rates. Stage Rates are set up incrementally to reflect the levels of water shortage emergency as defined in the District's Urban Water Management Plan, specifically the Water Shortage Contingency Plan. The current stage rate, which is in addition to, and on top of, the the standard base per unit water consumption rate for customers both inside and outside the District, is $0.82 per unit of water. At the end of March, the District Board of Directors rescinded the Water Shortage Emergency Stage Rates effective April 1. Bills issued in April and May will be pro-rated accordingly. Water Shortage Stage Systemwide Demand Reduction Stage Rate Amount 0 0% $0.000/Unit 1 10% $0.52/Unit 2a 15% $0.82/Unit 2b 20% $1.16/Unit 3a 25% $1.55/Unit 3b 30% $2.00/Unit 4 40% $3.12/Unit 5 50% $4.62/Unit 6 Up to 60% $6.90/Unit Bimonthly Meter Service Charge Water customers are charged a fixed service charge based on the size of each meter at the customer\u2019s property. For residential customers \u2013 who typically have a meter accommodating either 5/8- or 3/4-inch pipe -- the current service charge is $61.30 bi-monthly. The charge is designed to recover costs which do not vary with consumption. These costs include meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the District's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the District's commodity charge which is based on the amount of water consumed.

One unit is equivalent to 100 cubic feet or 748 gallons of water. The water consumption charge is currently $4.78 per unit for the typical customer. The average single-family residential customer currently uses about 16 units of water in a two-month billing cycle, or about 200 gallons per day. This means an average bi-monthly bill of $137.78 Commodity Rates (All Customers): \u00a0 Type Base Rate Per 100 Cubic Feet (100 Cubic Feet Equals 748 Gallons) Inside District $4.78 Outside District $5.46 Bi-monthly Private Fire Service Charge Private fire services are charged a bimonthly service charge based on the size of the service line.\u00a0 Service Line Size (Inch) Amount 3/4\" $ 8.25 1\" $ 8.44 2\" $ 10.37 4\" $ 22.32 6\" $ 49.47 8\" $ 96.29 10\" $ 166.73 12\" $ 264.36 Cost Breakdown To help customers understand how the District spends its funds, ACWD illustrates the FY 2022/23 budget in two ways: by  major revenues and expenses. Customer Assistance Program - Help on Tap ACWD recognizes some customers may experience difficulty paying their water bills. The District\u2019s customer assistance program,  Help on Tap,\u00a0 provides income-qualified residential customers a credit equal to 100% of the bimonthly water service charge, currently $61.30. More information and applications for Help on Tap are available on the District\u2019s website.

Home About Us Customer Service Detect a Water Leak Galvanized Service Line Leaks                         Galvanized Service Line Possible Leak Causes\t\t               Galvanized service lines could be the cause of leaks Trying to find and fix a leak? Your galvanized service lines could be the culprit. Galvanized pipes typically have an average lifespan between 40 and 50 years. Read on to learn more about the life span of galvanized pipes and how to identify and fix leaking galvanized service lines. \u00a0 How long do galvanized service lines last? The installation of galvanized steel plumbing was popular prior to the 1960s. Towards the end of the decade, the discovery of other plumbing materials led to fewer and fewer homes constructed using galvanized steel pipes. The pipe\u2019s material and being underground will cause them to naturally corrode over time and lose sufficient mechanical strength to provide service. This typically occurs after 40 to 50 years of service and results in leaks. If your home has galvanized pipes, it is essential to know their age. Pipes from the 1960s or earlier that haven\u2019t already been replaced are likely galvanized steel pipes and will be nearing the end of their lifespan. To determine the material of your pipes, one option is to brush off any rust and debris on the pipe, then use a household magnet to see if it sticks to the pipe. A magnet will stick to galvanized steel. An alternative would be to contact a qualified plumber. Should you determine that your pipes are over 40 years old, you may want to consider scheduling a consultation with a qualified plumber. You do not automatically need to replace galvanized pipes due to their age. While these pipes are no longer used for plumbing water service lines, there is nothing inherently wrong with them. Given that they are holding up well, galvanized pipes will do their job. \u00a0 How to identify a service line leak Below are some common signs that there may be problems with your galvanized pipes: Low water pressure:  As galvanized pipes age, corrosion products can accumulate on the insides, reducing the space where water can flow, and may cause low water pressure. Patches of extra green grass in your yard:  If you have wet patches in your yard or areas where the grass and/or landscaping is always extra healthy you may have a water leak, especially if this area is along the same path as your water service line. This same phenomenon can also occur along leaky irrigation piping, which should also be addressed. Water stains:  Even if you do not see a leak or wetness, a water stain means that water has been leaking. This is a major problem, as a small leak can quickly become a bigger one. A run on your meter: For Customers who have an AMI meter, simply log into your ACWD My Smart Water Connect portal account to view your consumption. If you have continuous consumption every interval throughout the day, particularly for multiple days in a row, you may have a leak. \u00a0 For Customer who have not had their water meter upgraded to AMI, if you open your meter box, and all water appliances in your home are off but you still see consumption on the water meter, you may have a leak. Find additional resources for identifying a run on your meter. Alternatively, a qualified plumber will be able to assist you with locating leaks on your service lines. \u00a0 Who is responsible for service lines? Replacing and repairing plumbing can be expensive. It\u2019s important to know your responsibility as a home or property owner so you can plan ahead. ACWD owns the public side water line in the street and from the street to your meter box. \u00a0ACWD also owns the meter box, meter box lid, and water meter. The property owner owns the plumbing from the meter connection to the house and throughout the house. Learn more about plumbing responsibilities and view a diagram. California plumbing codes require that service lines and plumbing meet minimum mechanical strength and water pressure requirements. \u00a0 The District has ongoing maintenance programs to upgrade its water meters and water lines. If your private-side service line, which is the owner\u2019s responsibility, has not been inspected recently and we find the service line requires repair during our maintenance work, ACWD will contact the property owner. It\u2019s important to keep the plumbing in a serviceable condition to ensure uninterrupted water service and prevent water waste.

Home About Us Customer Service Detect a Water Leak Possible Leak Causes                         Possible Leak Causes\t\t               Faucets Faucet leaks are usually caused by worn washers or \"O\" rings (for washerless faucets). To repair, turn off the water supply line to that faucet, replace the washer and turn on the line again. Toilets To determine if your toilet is leaking, look at the toilet bowl after the tank has stopped filling. If the water is still running into the bowl, or if you can hear water running, your toilet is leaking. If you do not see or hear water running, your toilet may have a silent leak. To test for a silent leak, drop a little food coloring into the tank. Do not flush. Wait for about 20 minutes. If the food coloring appears in the toilet bowl, your toilet has a silent leak. It is probably located in or around the plunger ball or flapper valve at the bottom of the tank. These leaks are easy to fix with parts from your hardware or home store. Irrigation Systems There are a number of ways to determine if your irrigation system is leaking. Taller, greener vegetation or moss growing around the sprinkler heads are signs of a damaged or dirty valve. Clean grit from valves and replace worn gaskets or seals. Wet spots, mud, and eroding soil may indicate a broken pipe or riser. Dry spots in your lawn could also be a sign that a sprinkler is damaged. To locate the source of the leak, you'll need to dig around the sprinkler. Wet spots or muddy areas around the valves point to a loose connection or aging washers. Wet spots on pavement also indicate possible leaks. Watch your sprinklers in action to determine which one is showering on the pavement. Then turn off the water and check the sprinkler head and riser. Sprinklers sprouting geysers of water indicate broken sprinkler heads. Replace them. Other Possible Culprits A warm or hot spot on your floor, combined with an increase in your natural gas bill, could indicate a broken hot water pipe in the concrete slab beneath your home. If this is the case, you will probably need to call a plumber to reroute the pipes. Check outside taps for leaking water, particularly during the summer watering season. A hose mistakenly left dribbling away on the grass or garden can waste thousands of gallons of water over the course of the summer.

(You will be able to tell if you have a smart meter if the meter box lid is plastic, or you see a 3-inch black circle in the lid. Please do not attempt to lift the lid as this may damage the wiring.) \u00a0 If you have a meter that has been upgraded to a new smart water meter, instructions on how to check for leaks can be found  here .\u00a0 If you have a meter that has not yet been upgraded, one option is to observe your water meter. Turn off all faucets and water-using appliances, such as the ice maker, dishwasher and clothes washer. Locate your water meter (PDF)  and lift the cover to see the meter dial. Lift the lid carefully in case you have had a smart meter installed as the wiring may get damaged with excessive force. If you see a wire connecting the meter to an endpoint (transmitter), carefully replace the lid and login to ACWD\u2019s My Smart Water Connect online portal where you can see your consumption and any alerts. If the needle is moving, you may have a leak. If the needle appears to be still, record the meter reading or mark the needle position with a pencil or piece of tape. Keep the water off. Wait at least 15-30 minutes. (Make sure nobody turns on a water-using appliance). Reread the meter gauge or check the needle location again. If the needle has moved, you could possibly have a leak somewhere in your system. Determine If Your Leak Is Inside Or Outside Your House First, determine you have a leak using the steps outlined above. If you have a leak, follow these steps. Shut off the main water valve  to the inside of your house. Return to the water meter and lift the cover to see the meter dial. If the needle appears to be still, record the meter reading or mark the needle position with a pencil or piece of tape. Keep the water off. Wait at least 15-30 minutes. (Make sure nobody turns on a water-using appliance). If the needle has moved and the water is shut off to the house, you have a leak somewhere outside of the house. If the meter has not moved and the water to the house is shut off, your leak is somewhere inside the house.

Home About Us Backflow Prevention Backflow Prevention Explained                         Backflow Prevention Explained\t\t               Preventing Contamination The Alameda County Water District works hard to protect your drinking water from contamination. This effort begins at the well or watershed where your water is collected, and continues through the entire treatment and distribution process. But what about after the water reaches your home or business? Who protects the water from the meter to your glass. Read on for some important information about the hazards of backflow, and what we all can do to maintain the safety of our water supply. ACWD's Cross Connection Control Program Fortunately, there have not been any documented backflow incidents impacting our local water system, and we are taking steps to keep it that way. ACWD's Cross Connection Control Program, which fully satisfies the requirements of Title 17, begins with the identification of businesses, industries, and residential areas that are likely to contain cross connections. As mandated by the state, an on-site survey of the property is conducted by one of our certified Cross Connection Specialists. They often suggest ways to protect the internal water system against backflow and, if necessary, ask the consumer to install a backflow prevention device at the meter that will protect the public water supply. After the device is installed, the law requires that it be tested by a certified test person at least once a year. Backflow Hazards at Home How many times have you put a garden hose in a bucket of soapy water to wash the car? Or sprayed insecticide with a garden hose sprayer? Or attached a hand spray attachment to the kitchen faucet to wash your hair or the dog? These seemingly harmless actions create cross connections that could endanger the health and safety of you, your family, and your neighbors. The danger comes when the hose comes in contact with a harmful substance. If the pressure in the water main drops while the hose is submerged in contaminated water, then the water (and whatever is in it) could be sucked back into your pipes and the drinking water supply. Water pressure drops are not uncommon. They can occur when hydrants are opened to fight fires or during repairs to a broken water main. Fortunately, keeping your water safe from these contaminants is easy,  as illustrated in this diagram (PDF) . Private Wells Backflow can also occur in the absence of a water main pressure drop. For example, some homes have backup water systems supplied by private wells or springs. If these systems are connected and overcome the pressure in the public water supply, backflow will occur. Because these private supplies are not tested and regulated by governmental agencies, they may pose a hazard to the potable water system and must be equipped with proper backflow prevention devices. Commercial-Industrial Requirements In commercial or industrial situations, water often comes in contact with different types of hazardous substances, whether it be for mixing, diluting, flushing, or cleaning. State law requires that certain businesses be surveyed for potential cross connections and that proper backflow prevention devices be installed to protect the public water supply. ACWD surveys manufacturing plants, hospitals, mortuaries, dental offices, dialysis centers, veterinary clinics, doctors' offices and many other businesses in order to identify potential hazards to the water system. If your business requires a survey, we will contact you for an appointment and meet with you at your facility to identify specific hazards and discuss the applicable backflow prevention requirements. We realize that there is some inconvenience and often some expense in complying with these requirements. Our Cross Connection Specialists will make every effort to work with you to facilitate the installation and testing of the appropriate device if needed.

(If you live in an older home, the house valve may be located elsewhere.) The valve handle is usually red, grey or green and is shaped like a wagon wheel. Should you ever need to shut off your water, simply turn the house valve clockwise. You will probably want to close the valve if a water pipe in your home ever breaks to prevent water damage and flooding. If you discover that your house lacks water, the first thing you should do is check the house valve to see if someone has accidentally closed it. To open the valve, turn it counterclockwise. To make sure you can readily control the flow of water to your home, you should periodically test your house valve. If it does not turn or spins freely, it should be repaired or replaced as soon as possible. A plumber can do this work quite easily. \t\t               \u25bc  Customers - Customer Service\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   How do I shut off my water?

What is the bimonthly service charge on my water bill?    The district's service charge is levied against all customers in the district on a bimonthly basis based on the size of each meter on the customer's premises. The charge is designed to recover costs that do not vary with consumption. These costs include those of meter reading and billing customers for each bimonthly period, a portion of the district's debt service costs, and maintenance and replacement of meters and service lines in the distribution system. The charge is in addition to the district's commodity charge, which is based on the amount of water consumed.\t\t\t         3.   Whose pipes are whose?    The Alameda County Water District is responsible for pipes on the \"street side\" of the water meter, including all service lines and water mains extending throughout the community. ACWD is also responsible for the water meter itself. If you notice a water leak in the street or in the vicinity of your water meter, please contact the ACWD Operations department at (510) 668-6500 to report it. The property owner is generally responsible for all pipes and plumbing on the \"customer side\" of the water meter. This includes the interior plumbing of the home, the outside irrigation system, and the area where the property's water system connects to the water meter.           4.   What are the white spots left on my car after I wash it?    These spots are composed of calcium carbonate, a mineral commonly found in water. This is the same mineral found in many calcium supplements sold at your local drug store.\t\t\t         5.   How do I read my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           6.   Where is my water meter?     See\t\t\t Locate and Read Your Water Meter           7.   How do I start or stop my water service?    Go to\t\t\t Starting and Stopping Service page           8.   How often does ACWD replace my water meter?    The primary source of revenue for the Alameda County Water District is through the water consumption of residential customers who have 5/8\u201d or 3/4\u201d water meters. These meters make up about 90% of all District meters and generate about half of all consumption revenues. Economical operation of these meters is therefore an integral part of the District\u2019s effort to provide high quality water at reasonable costs. Since water meters are mechanical devices, their accuracy decreases over time which means a corresponding loss of potential revenue. To gain additional accuracy, however, would mean replacing the meters at additional cost. How old does a meter have to be before it makes economical sense to replace it? To answer this question, the District used statistical sampling methods to determine meter accuracies over time. An economical analysis was then performed to determine an optimal replacement age. Together with operational factors, the optimum age at which to replace plastic meters in the District was found to be approximately 15 years old.\t\t\t         9.   Where can I pay my water bill?     Go to\t\t\t Payment Locations page           10.   What are the options for paying my ACWD water bill?    Go to \t\t\t Bill Payment Options page           11.   When is my bill due?    All bills are owed and payable by the due date listed on the Statement for Water Service.\t\t\t         12.   Why is ACWD just now charging a late fee?    The Board of Directors adopted the new fees effective March 1, 2017. As a courtesy, and to provide additional time for notifying customers, the fees were waived from March 1, 2017 to September 1, 2017.\t\t\t         13.   Why is the late fee $5?    The $5 fee assists in covering costs incurred by the District for additional postage, staff time, and materials. \t\t\t         14.   How can ACWD justify the $5 charge?    An analysis was completed by District staff and an independent outside consultant firm to determine an estimate of cost incurred by the District. A new analysis is completed prior to any changes to fees or charges. \t\t\t         15.   Can the new fees or charges be waived?    As a courtesy, the District waived all new fees and charges from March 1, 2017 through September 1, 2017. If a customer is experiencing extreme financial hardship, a payment arrangement may be made by contacting Customer Service staff.\t\t\t         16.   Are accounts with a payment arrangement charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    No, as long as the customer upholds the agreed upon payment arrangement. The purpose of a payment arrangement is to provide qualifying customers additional time to pay their bill without incurring additional fees.\t\t\t         17.   I mailed my payment before the due date. Why am I being charged a late fee?    Bills are considered past due if payment is not received and applied to the account by the due date. Any delays with mailed payments should be addressed with the United States Postal Service (USPS). The District recommends payments be made electronically by the due date, or mailed via the USPS at least seven business days in advance due to varied postage transit times.\t\t\t         18.   My payment was deducted from my bank account on/before the due date. Why am I still being charged a Reminder Notice Fee?    If your payment was deducted from your bank account on or prior to the due date, contact Customer Service. If Customer Service staff confirms an on-time payment was made, the Reminder Notice Fee will be reversed.\t\t\t         19.   I didn\u2019t receive the regular bill. Do I still need to pay the Reminder Notice Fee?    Yes. As a recipient of water service, you are responsible to keep your water account current. The District has rigid processes ensuring each account is billed, and subsequent notice is provided electronically or mailed each billing cycle. The District cannot guarantee services provided by the USPS or individual email service providers.  If you are concerned that your bill did not arrive as expected, please contact Customer Service for assistance.\t\t\t         20.   I didn\u2019t receive the door tag. Do I still need to pay the charge?    Yes. District staff does not assess a 48-hour Door Notice charge unless a notice is left on the property. District staff does their best to leave the door notice in a secure location (typically on a doorknob) but cannot guarantee what happens to the notice after placement. \t\t\t         21.   Why is there a field charge?     There is a cost to the District to mail reminder notices or send staff into the field to place door notices or shutoff service.  The District charges fees for these and other services so the applicable party pays for these costs instead of the general District ratepayer.  While many District fees are designed to recover the full cost the activity, the new $20 field charges for door tags and shutoff are less than the District\u2019s full cost.  Actual District cost for a staff person to travel to a customer\u2019s service address during normal business hours to place a tag or turn service off or on is $42.  This is the amount of the pre-existing field service charge.\t\t\t         22.   Why is there a line for the Alameda County Water District on my property tax bill?     The Alameda County Water District has a long-term financial obligation as a member of the State Water Project and collects a portion of its state water costs on the property tax bill. The amounts collected are adjusted each year based on the District\u2019s state water costs. The State Water Project provides about 40% of the District\u2019s water supply in a typical year.

It is a conventional ozone plant used to treat water delivered via the South Bay Aqueduct. It is located on Mission Boulevard near the I-680 interchange in Fremont. Functions WTP2 uses the following chemical additions: carbon dioxide to lower the pH of the raw water for process stabilization and bromate control, chloramines pre-ozone to maintain low bromate levels, ozone as a pre-oxidant, and ferric chloride or alum as a coagulant. There are two separate process trains consisting of six flocculation basins, four sedimentation basins and six dual media filters with post-filter addition of chlorine, ammonia, fluoride, and sodium hydroxide The maximum design production rate at WTP2 is 28 million gallons per day (MGD). However, this production rate is reduced due to recirculation of some process flows and reduced output when filters are off-line for backwashing. As a result, the sustainable production rate at WTP2 is 26 MGD.

It utilizes a reverse osmosis (RO) membrane filtration process to treat brackish groundwater. The facility is located near Cherry and Central Avenue in Newark. Functions The first phase of the NDF production produced up to 5 MGD of permeate water. After an expansion of the plant was finalized in August 2010, it doubled the production of permeate to 10 MGD for a total blended production of 12.5 MGD to the distribution system. Chlorinated well water is combined with permeate water to increase the hardness prior to entering the distribution system. Chlorine, ammonia, fluoride, and sodium hydroxide are added as finished water chemicals.

Functions The BF utilizes three parallel in-line static mixers each with a design capacity of 20 MGD, which provide the mixing for the water from the Mowry and Peralta / Tyson Wellfields, and San Francisco Regional Water Supplies. The BF production rate is limited by several factors including hydraulic capacity, hardness targets, and water costs. Normal sustainable output from the BF is 45 million gallons per day (MGD), however the distribution system can be valved such that total production from the BF can reach 60 MGD.

This water is imported from the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta and/or Lake Del Valle via the South Bay Aqueduct and is purified at our water treatment plants before being delivered to customers living in central and south Fremont. Storage Facilities The SWP, managed by the DWR, is the largest state-built, multi-purpose water project in the country. The SWP facilities include 21 dams and reservoirs; 21 pumping plants; 4 pumping-generating plants; 5 hydroelectric power plants; and approximately 700 miles of aqueducts. The water stored in the SWP storage facilities originates from rainfall and snowmelt runoff in Northern and Central California watersheds. The SWP's primary storage facility is Lake Oroville in the Feather River Watershed. Releases from Lake Oroville flow down the Feather River to the Sacramento River, which subsequently flows to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Water Delivery The SWP diverts water from the Delta through the Banks Pumping Plant which lifts water from the Clifton Court Forebay (in the Delta) to the California Aqueduct and Bethany Reservoir. From Bethany Reservoir, the South Bay Pumping Plant lifts water into the South Bay Aqueduct, which delivers State Water Project supplies to ACWD and other Bay Area water agencies in Alameda and Santa Clara Counties.

These agencies are known jointly as the SBA Contractors. In 2005, the South Bay Aqueduct Watershed Workgroup was formed to help protect water quality within the aqueduct by protecting the watershed lands surrounding it. The workgroup had three primary objectives: Develop a Watershed Management Program for the South Bay Aqueduct system, including Lake Del Valle and Bethany Reservoir. Protect local drinking water from identified contaminant sources. Protect water resources in the local area for urban, agricultural, recreational, and environmental uses. Sponsors This project was sponsored by a Proposition 13 Non-point Source Pollution Control Grant from the State Water Resource Control Board for the CALFED Bay-Delta Program and guided by the South Bay Aqueduct Watershed Workgroup. Available Materials SBA Watershed Protection Program Plan - This plan describes the SBA Watershed and provides information on actions that can help protect water quality.

This supply is predominantly from the Sierra Nevada, delivered through the Hetch-Hetchy aqueducts, but also includes treated water produced by the SFPUC from its local watersheds and facilities in Alameda and San Mateo Counties. The amount of imported water available to the SFPUC's retail and wholesale customers is constrained by hydrology, physical facilities, and the institutional parameters that allocate the water supply of the Tuolumne River. Due to these constraints, the SFPUC is very dependent on reservoir storage to firm-up its water supplies. Water System Improvement Program In order to enhance the ability of the SFPUC water supply system to meet identified service goals for water quality, seismic reliability, delivery reliability, and water supply, the SFPUC has undertaken the Water System Improvement Program.

This runoff, together with water released from the South Bay Aqueduct at a location east of the town of Sunol, flows down Alameda Creek and into the Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel. Here, the water is captured behind three large, inflatable rubber dams. These dams divert water to the Quarry Lakes where water percolates to recharge the underlying groundwater basin. About sixteen wells are used to extract water from the groundwater basin. Together, these wells are capable of producing up to 47.5 million gallons of water per day. This water is blended with San Francisco Regional Water System supplies before being delivered to customers. Groundwater Monitoring The continued protection and enhancement of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin is vital to ACWD's ability to continue to meet the water supply needs of the people it serves. Consequently, the basin has been the object of vigorous conservation activities on the part of the District. These activities have included an extensive monitoring program to determine the location and movement of saltwater that has intruded into a portion of the groundwater basin.

Diablo in the north to Mt. Hamilton in the south, and east to Altamont Pass. The area is populated by more than 200,000 people living in five cities\u2014Dublin, parts of Danville and San Ramon, Livermore, Pleasanton\u2014and thousands more living in unincorporated areas. Most of the watershed is undeveloped, open range. Another large portion is comprised of public lands and parks. A smaller portion is used as cropland. Only about seven percent of the total acreage is used for residential, commercial, and industrial purposes. The average rainfall in the Alameda Creek watershed is approximately 20 inches per year. Runoff from much of the southern region is collected in Calaveras and San Antonio Reservoirs, which are part of San Francisco's water system. Runoff from much of the southeast portion is collected in Del Valle Reservoir, some of which is diverted to ACWD via the South Bay Aqueduct. Runoff from the northern region flows to tributaries of Alameda Creek, where it is carried to ACWD facilities and used for groundwater recharge. The Supply Virtually all of our local water supply (which comprises 40% of our total distribution system supply) originates in the Alameda Creek watershed. Rainwater runoff from the watershed and a portion of our State Water Project supply is captured behind three large, inflatable rubber dams which span the width of the Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel. These dams divert water to several hundred acres of ponds (former gravel quarries) where water percolates to recharge the underlying Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. Watershed Protection Protecting the integrity of the watershed is of critical importance to ACWD. The District continuously samples, analyzes, and monitors the quality of water in Alameda Creek at a special monitoring facility located at the mouth of Niles Canyon near Mission Boulevard and at other key locations throughout the watershed. In addition, we work with property owners and other agencies to encourage proper use of watershed lands so that the water quality in the creek is protected and maintained.

Local supplies include fresh groundwater from the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin (underlying the District service area), desalinated brackish groundwater from portions of the groundwater basin previously impacted by seawater intrusion, and surface water from the Del Valle Reservoir. The primary source of recharge for the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin is from percolation of runoff from the Alameda Creek watershed. To a lesser degree, a portion of ACWD's SWP supplies are also used for local groundwater percolation. Infiltration of rainfall and applied water also contribute to local groundwater recharge. Water Supply Planning The District develops comprehensive, long-term planning documents to manage our water supply and ensure we meet current and future demands. Integrated Resources Plan (PDF) Urban Water Management Plan Water Supply Reliability Fact Sheet (PDF) Regional Water Supply Efforts The Bay Area Regional Reliability (BARR) Partners include the following: Alameda County Water District Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency Contra Costa Water District East Bay Municipal Utility District Marin Municipal Water District San Francisco Public Utilities Commission Santa Clara Valley Water District Zone 7 Water Agency. The BARR Partners have joined forces to leverage existing facilities and, if needed, build new ones to bolster regional water supply reliability. BARR website Treatment Before being supplied to ACWD's customers, the source water supplies are treated to meet and surpass all state and federal drinking water standards. ACWD operates one surface water treatment plant that treats SWP and local surface water from Del Valle Reservoir. The Newark Desalination Facility treats brackish groundwater to remove salts and other impurities, and the Blending Facility blends San Francisco water with local fresh groundwater (with higher hardness) to provide a blended supply with lower overall hardness. Meeting Demands ACWD\u2019s diverse water supply portfolio helps the District to provide water supply reliability. During a typical year, the District receives water from: San Francisco Regional System (imported)- 20%* State Water Project (imported) \u2013 40%* Alameda Creek Watershed (local) \u2013 40%* \u00a0 *Amounts are approximate                                                Alameda Creek Watershed Local Supplies           Niles Cone Groundwater Basin           San Francisco Regional Water System           South Bay Aqueduct Watershed Protection           State Water Project           Treatment Plant Descriptions             Blending Facility           Newark Desalination Facility           Regional Water System Direct Takeoff           Water Treatment Plant No. 2               Diversion Data             M001323_Grandstand 72 Meter           M001165_Bunting Fish Screen Meter           M001423_Kaiser Fish Screen Meter           M031656 - Shinn Fish Screens 24-inch Meter           M031664 - Shinn Fish Screens 36-inch Meter           M031665 - Shinn Fish Screens 48-inch Meter                                                         My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Home About Us About ACWD Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area                         Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area\t\t               About Quarry Lakes Quarry Lakes Regional Recreation Area in Fremont is jointly administered by the East Bay Regional Park District (EBRPD) and the Alameda County Water District. EBRPD operates the park as a recreational facility featuring water-related activities such as swimming, \u00a0fishing, wind surfing, and boating. ACWD uses the lakes for recharging the aquifers of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin, an immense, natural reservoir lying beneath the Tri-City area. This is accomplished by: Storing water in the Alameda Creek Flood Control Channel behind inflatable rubber dams; Diverting the stored water into the Quarry Lakes; Allowing the lake water to percolate into the groundwater basin. The Niles Cone supplies up to half of the water used in Fremont, Newark, and Union City. More Information Find out more about the recreational opportunities available at Quarry Lakes by visiting the  EBRPD website . For the Quarry Lakes fish planting schedule, see EBRPD's  Angler's Edge Online . To protect wildlife and water quality, lead fishing tackle is prohibited at Quarry Lakes. The  Quarry Lakes Lead Fishing Tackle Awareness and Exchange Program  was created to educate local anglers on the hazards of using lead fishing tackle and to provide the opportunity for a no-cost exchange of toxic lead split-shot weights and sinkers for lead-free split-shot weights and sinkers.

ACWD dedicates this page to our past Directors who have shown outstanding dedication, knowledge and direction, providing the groundwork for the successful organization ACWD is today.

The history of the District has been closely intertwined with the area it serves throughout this time. In fact, the District was originally formed to protect and responsibly manage the Niles Cone groundwater basin, which underlies the local area. Since then, the District has seen significant change, but continues a tradition of stewardship in meeting our mission to provide a reliable supply of high quality water at a reasonable price.

Home About Us About ACWD Board of Directors Ward-Based Election System                         Ward-Based Election System\t\t               As of November 2022, Members of ACWD's Board of Directors are Elected Based on Voting District Wards (also known as \"Districts\" or \"Zones\") The Alameda County Water District Board of Directors transitioned from at-large to ward-based elections in 2022. Voters within the ACWD service area now elect their representatives on the ACWD Board based on which ward they are in, and voters only elect one representative for their ward. Voters in wards 2 and 3 elect their representatives every four years beginning in November 2022. \u00a0 Voters in wards 1, 4, and 5 elect their representatives every four years beginning in November 2024. ACWD's Completed Transition for At-Large to Ward-Based Elections Background The Alameda County Water District Board of Directors has completed the transition from at-large to ward-based elections. Prior to this process, the Board of Directors was elected using an at-large elections system, which means voters of the entire District elected the five Board members. A ward-based election is one in which the District is geographically divided into separate wards, each with one Board member who resides in the ward and is chosen by the voters in that particular ward \u00a0 Directors serve four-year staggered terms and are elected in even-numbered years. The District received a letter from a law firm alleging that the District\u2019s current at-large elections violate the California Voting Rights Act (CVRA) (Elections Code \u00a7\u00a7 14025-14032). \u00a0The CVRA prohibits the use of at-large elections if doing so impairs the ability of a protected class to elect candidates of its choice or to influence the outcome of an election. \u00a0Numerous public agencies, including the District, have been contacted by private law firms alleging violations of the CVRA in a push to move agencies to ward-based (also known as \"district\" or \"zone-based\") election systems. \u00a0The District does not agree with these allegations with respect to elections of the District\u2019s Board of Directors. \u00a0However, the Board desires that its members represent the interests and wishes of all residents within the jurisdiction of the District, and that the community have confidence that the Board continues to represent the interests and wishes of the District. \u00a0Therefore, on August 12, 2021, the Board adopted  Resolution No. 21-050  declaring its intention to change from at-large to ward-based elections. \u00a0                        The Transition Process Community input and 2020 census data was used to determine how wards should be drawn. \u00a0 To assist with the transition, the District hired Lapkoff & Gobalet Demographic Research, Inc. (Lapkoff and Gobalet), a firm that specializes in drawing election ward boundaries for jurisdictions, also known as \u201cdistricting.\u201d Many factors may be considered in developing the wards and draft maps. \u00a0Population equality is of primary importance, followed by the Federal Voting Rights Act\u2019s prohibition of voting practices and procedures that discriminate on the basis of race, color or membership in a language minority group. Additionally, other factors include: Topography: natural barriers, boundaries or landmarks Geography: major streets and neighborhood blocks Cohesiveness: contiguity, integrity and compactness of the area Communities of Interest: established neighborhoods, racial and social demographics, groups with cultural bonds, common issues or concerns, voting precincts and other types of divisions.\u00a0 The District emphasized public input throughout the transition process. \u00a0The District conducted five duly noticed public hearings over two phases to review the process of converting to a ward-based election system, receive input from the public on communities of interest within the District\u2019s service area, and review and receive public input on draft voting district ward maps: Phase 1: Community Input On October 14, 2021, and October 28, 2021, the District conducted duly noticed public hearings to describe the transition process and solicit public input on communities of interest and other factors that should be considered in the development of draft voting district ward maps. \u00a0Lapkoff and Gobalet considered such input, together with the most current federal census data, in the development of five draft voting district ward maps which were published and posted on the District\u2019s website on January 3, 2022. Phase 2: Voting District Ward Mapping On January 13, 2022, the District conducted a third duly noticed public hearing to present the five draft voting district ward maps and receive input from the public and from the Board. \u00a0Based on input received during this public hearing, two of the draft maps (Plan numbers 4 and 5) were removed from further consideration. On February 17, 2022, the District conducted a fourth duly noticed public hearing to present the three remaining draft voting district ward maps and receive further input from the public and from the Board. \u00a0At this public hearing, Lapkoff and Gobalet provided additional details regarding the differences among the three draft maps, and the sequence of elections was discussed. On March 10, 2022, the District conducted a fifth duly noticed public hearing to present the remaining draft voting district ward maps, including the potential boundaries of the five proposed wards, for public input regarding configuration of the wards and communities of interest to assist in selecting the final voting district ward map, as well as the final sequence of elections. \u00a0Following the public hearing, the Board adopted an ordinance establishing a final voting district ward map ( Plan 3  ) and sequence of elections. The adopted sequence of elections is as follows: Voters in wards 2 and 3 elect their representatives every four years beginning in November 2022. \u00a0 Voters in wards 1, 4, and 5 elect their representatives every four years beginning in November 2024.

These terms all used \u00a0to describe the distinct geographical area from which voters elect their ACWD representative. During the transition process the terms \"voting district\" and \"zone\" were used to describe these areas. However, because the Alameda County Registrar of Voters prefers the term \"ward,\" customer communications and interactive maps use this term to align with County election materials and related documents and processes.

As a public agency, ACWD cannot take in funds beyond the costs of providing its service. The District periodically conducts an analysis to ensure water rates accurately reflect the cost of water service. The District also uses outside expert consultants to ensure that its rates are properly determined. Following a series of public workshops, the District notifies customers and the public about any proposed rate adjustments through various means: A formal notice of any proposed rate adjustments is mailed to all addresses within the District\u2019s service boundaries. The formal notice contains the details of a public hearing where the revisions are proposed to be adopted by the Board after a formal 45 day public input period.  View the most recently issued notice of rate adjustments that was distributed in December 2022 .\u00a0 Postings to the District\u2019s website and social media sites Email notifications to customers who have subscribed to receive board meeting notices Press Releases Printed advertisements in local newspapers. The District continuously looks for and implements ways to be efficient and control costs. These include managing the District's diverse water supplies to maximize use of lowest-cost water, installing Advanced Metering Infrastructure to improve metering accuracy and provide long-term cost reductions and operational savings, increasing energy efficiency to reduce power costs, lowering costs related to our vehicle fleet by transitioning to a leasing program, and partnering with other agencies to execute joint projects to reduce costs and community impacts. Cost controls have helped keep the District\u2019s water rates consistently in the lower half of 30 Bay Area water agencies. You can view a chart that illustrates \u00a0ACWD\u2019s current median water bill in comparison to other Bay Area water agencies.

In fact, experts predict a 70% chance of a magnitude 6.7 or greater earthquake occurring in the San Francisco Bay Area within the next 30 years. Are you and your family prepared for such a disaster? While ACWD\u2019s disaster preparedness efforts include extensive measures to protect the water system from damage resulting from earthquakes, many breaks in our water system pipelines will undoubtedly occur. In fact, the damage to ACWD\u2019s system from a major earthquake could be so severe that the reliable supply of high quality drinking water our customers rely upon and have learned to expect could be interrupted for an extended period of time. That\u2019s why one of the most important things that you can do to get ready for an earthquake (or any other disaster) is to store an adequate amount of emergency drinking water. You can survive weeks without food, but only a few days without water. In addition to the emergency preparedness resource links and  FAQs  provided in the menu boxes on the right of this page, ACWD strongly encourages you to complete the  Family Disaster Planning Worksheet (PDF) .                                         Family Disaster Planning Worksheet (PDF) Use this worksheet to create an emergency communications plan, supply kit, and action plans for you and your family. The short amount of time it takes you to complete this worksheet and properly prepare can make all the difference for how well you and your family safely endure a disaster situation!
