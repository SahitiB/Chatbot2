Home Services Groundwater Resources Sustainable Groundwater Management Act                         Sustainable Groundwater Management Act\t\t               Sustainable Groundwater Management Act On September 16, 2014, the Governor signed a three-bill package known as the  Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA)  into law that establishes a new structure for groundwater management, recognizing that groundwater management in California is best accomplished locally. For over 100 years, the Alameda County Water District (ACWD) has managed the groundwater of the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin (Niles Cone Subbasin 2-09.01) through comprehensive programs that protect and improve water supplies for all groundwater users. ACWD is identified within SGMA as an agency created by statute to manage groundwater and deemed to be the exclusive local agency within its statutory boundaries to comply with SGMA (California Water Code Section 10723 et seq.). Alternative to a Groundwater Sustainability Plan As an exclusive local agency responsible for groundwater management and a Groundwater Sustainability Agency (GSA), ACWD submitted an Alternative to a Groundwater Sustainability Plan (Alternative) for the management of the Niles Cone Subbasin 2-09.01 under SGMA in 2016. ACWD\u2019s Alternative preserves and continues the successful sustainable groundwater management already being performed by ACWD. This is accomplished by continuing groundwater management under pre-existing authority by which ACWD carries out groundwater management efforts within Niles Cone, in addition to the authorities of a GSA under SGMA. \u00a0The existing planning and operating policies and documents under which ACWD currently manages the Niles Cone, and the existing information that demonstrates that ACWD has operated the Niles Cone within its sustainable yield for at least 10 years, satisfies the requirements of an Alternative. \u00a0These existing documents and information show that ACWD has managed the Niles Cone sustainably for decades, meeting the objective of SGMA. On July 17, 2019, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) approved ACWD\u2019s Alternative for the Niles Cone. DWR\u2019s approval was accompanied by a  Statement of Findings Regarding the Approval of the Niles Cone Subbasin Alternative  which included seven recommended actions for ACWD to incorporate in the five\u2011year update to the Alternative (Alternative Update), which was due on January 1, 2022. Per SGMA requirements, the Alternative Update will describe whether the Alternative is meeting sustainability goals and recommended actions. ACWD's  Alternative Update  was submitted to DWR on December 29, 2021. \u00a0As a result, a 75-day public comment period is now open from January 6, 2022, through March 22, 2022. \u00a0DWR is asking that all public comments on the Alternative Update be provided to DWR through their SGMA Portal. \u00a0The Alternative Update is not a plan amendment but is a 5-year written assessment that describes and provides an update on ACWD's groundwater management efforts, an explanation of how the Alternative Update is functionally equivalent to elements of a Groundwater Sustainability Plan, incorporates DWR's seven recommended actions, and includes information on proposed projects, management actions, and/or next steps to ensure the continued sustainable management of the Niles Cone. ACWD\u2019s Alternative,  Alternative Update , and Alternative  Annual Reports  can be found on DWR's SGMA Portal. Basin Boundary Modification DWR adopted emergency regulations regarding the process for seeking groundwater basin boundary modifications under SGMA. In Bulletin-118 Update 2003, the graphical representation included in Bulletin 118 (2003) did not match the written description of the northern boundary as it did not extend all the way to the northern boundary of ACWD including the areas located within the City of Hayward that were detached and that ACWD expressly retained groundwater management authority over. Since the basin boundaries in Bulletin 118 will now play a critical role in the management of California\u2019s groundwater basins, ACWD submitted a Basin Boundary Modification Request to correct the Niles Cone Groundwater Bas i n. On July 1, 2016, ACWD received notice from DWR that the Basin Boundary Modification Request had been approved, as modified by DWR. \u00a0 Groundwater Sustainability Agency Formation On November 10, 2016, ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors adopted  Resolution No. 16-069  deciding to become the GSA for the Niles Cone Subbasin 2-09.01. ACWD\u2019s becoming the GSA for the Niles Cone Subbasin continues existing groundwater management under SGMA, in addition to other recognized regulatory authority. SGMA provides various authorities to GSAs to promote sustainable groundwater management including the ability to meter wells and fund and implement groundwater management projects. While many of these authorities have been available to ACWD for many years under the Replenishment Assessment Act of the Alameda County Water District, SGMA provides additional authority that may further the ability of ACWD to sustainably manage the Niles Cone.

Further, on February 13, 2023, Governor Newsom issued  Executive Order N-3-23 , which provides an update on water use and supply conditions in California.\u00a0 Please call Kit Soo at 510-668-4455, Well Ordinance Supervisor, for more information regarding how the new water well permitting requirements may impact ACWD\u2019s permit application process. As required by ACWD Ordinance No. 2010-01, drilling permits are required prior to the start of any subsurface drilling activities for wells, exploratory holes, and other excavations. ACWD also requires a permit for inactive classification for any well or other excavation which will not be used for a period of 12 months, but which the owner intends to use in the future.  Please read the permit instructions to ensure submittal of a complete permit application package. All permitted work requires  scheduling for inspection ; therefore, all drilling activities must be coordinated with ACWD prior to the start of any field work.

Home Services Groundwater Resources Groundwater Protection Environmental Screening Levels                         Environmental Screening Levels\t\t               Description The document, \"User's Guide: Derivation and Application of Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs)\", - Interim Final 2016 (February 2016) is a technical report prepared by staff of the California Regional Water Quality Board, San Francisco Bay Region. Information provided in the document is not intended to establish policy or regulation. The document presents Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for chemicals commonly found in soil and groundwater at sites where releases of hazardous chemicals have occurred. The ESLs are presented in a series of tables. Each table reflects a specific combination of soil, groundwater and land-use characteristics that strongly influence the magnitude of environmental concerns at a given site. This allows the user to select ESLs that are most applicable to a given site. The Tier 1 ESLs presented in the lookup tables are NOT regulatory cleanup standards. The presence of a chemical at concentrations in excess of an ESL does not necessarily indicate that adverse impacts to human health or the environment are occurring; this simply indicates that a potential for adverse risk may exist and that additional evaluation is warranted.

The Regional Water Quality Control Board (PDF)  - Since 1988, ACWD informally provided assistance to the California Regional Water Quality Control Board - San Francisco Bay Region (Regional Board) in overseeing the investigation and remediation at leaking underground fuel tank (LUFT) and spills, leaks, investigation and cleanup (SLIC) sites.

Download a copy of the  Replenishment Assessment Act . Replenishment Assessment Rates\u00a0 Replenishment Assessment (RA) rates are reviewed annually; currently, the assessment is $8.00/acre-foot for agricultural and municipal-recreation uses (the maximum allowed under the Replenishment Assessment Act) and $513/acre-foot for all other uses.\u00a0\u00a0 Revenue from the RA helps ACWD offset its costs to replenish and maintain groundwater supplies for the benefit of the users of the groundwater basin. \u00a0A 4.9% increase in the RA rate for uses other than municipal-recreation and agricultural was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 11, 2023. \u00a0Effective July 1, 2023, the rate changed from $513 to $538 per acre-foot of groundwater extracted. \u00a0Only property owners with a well, well owners, and operators of wells (or other groundwater extraction facilities) within the ACWD-managed Niles Cone Groundwater Basin are affected by the increase.\u00a0 On April 11, 2023 the Board of Directors adopted Resolution No. 23-031, Levying a Replenishment Assessment and finding the Replenishment Assessment exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Pursuant Governor Newsom's Executive Order N-54-20 and as a result of the threat of COVID-19, the  Notice of Exemption  has been posted to our website and submitted to the State Clearinghouse CEQAnet Web Portal. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0                                                Annual Survey Report on Groundwater Conditions           Department of Water Resources Bulletins           DWR Groundwater Grant Programs           Groundwater Guardian Affiliate           Groundwater Management Policy           Niles Cone Groundwater Basin Monitoring           Water Research Foundation Project           Replenishment Assessment Act                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Field work occurs during the spring and fall of each year in order to provide insight into subsurface conditions when water levels tend to be at their highest and lowest. The program records the status of wells owned by public agencies and private owners, and includes the collection of groundwater samples and the measurement of groundwater levels throughout the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. A Groundwater Monitoring Report is prepared annually to document the results of the field data collection. Download a copy of the most recent  Groundwater Monitoring Report (PDF) .  California Statewide Groundwater Elevation Monitoring (CASGEM) Program The CASGEM Program was established in response to State Legislation which mandates a statewide monitoring program to track seasonal and long-term groundwater elevation trends in California's groundwater basins. In 2012, ACWD was designated by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) as a Monitoring Entity for the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin. As a Monitoring Entity, ACWD developed a monitoring plan and regularly submits groundwater level measurements to the DWR's online database in an effort to improve the management of California's groundwater resources.

Tour-goers will get a near fish-eye-view of the journey Anna, the steelhead trout, will be able to take once our projects are complete.  These projects have been decades in the making, with the help of our many partners, and are now nearing completion. We'll show the magnitude of these $78 million dollar projects (with partner support and grants) designed to allow threatened steelhead trout, like Anna and other fish species, to migrate easily and safely upstream and downstream.

The smaller and less complex pipeline renewal projects support the large-diameter transmission main renewal projects currently in progress.\u00a0 With planned construction on an as-needed basis, the Small Diameter Pipeline Renewal Program will provide more consistent year-to-year progress and expenditures within the District\u2019s Main Renewal Program. \u00a0\u00a0 The Small Diameter Pipeline Renewal Program includes nine project sites. Each site is comprised of multiple water mains and was chosen based on material type, age, and maintenance history. The water mains are generally older pipelines located in residential areas throughout Fremont, Newark, and Union City. Status The  Lindsay Tract Roadway and Drainage Improvements Project  is being led by the City of Newark, and ACWD is partnering to replace aging water mains for cost efficiency and to minimize impacts on customers. The water main replacement will be entirely funded through ACWD\u2019s Capital Improvements Program budget. Location Multiple project sites throughout Fremont, Newark, and Union City.

The leak must be repaired before installation can take place. This is your first and only courtesy notice regarding the leak. Please call our installation hotline once resolved. ACWD\u2019s Board of Directors adopted an Ordinance (NO. 2008-01) Prohibiting Wasteful Use of Water, to conserve the District\u2019s water supply and eliminate the wasteful use of water, especially\u00a0 critical\u00a0 due\u00a0 to drought. Under this Ordinance leaks are required to be repaired as soon as possible, and\u00a0 ACWD can invoke the enforcement process for non-compliance.

While California is experiencing drought, ACWD plans decades in advance to ensure that our water supply remains reliable, and AMI is one action we are taking today to save water for tomorrow. \u00a0 HOW WILL THIS IMPACT YOU? Temporary Water Stoppage: \u00a0  Your water service will be temporarily turned off\u2014for no more than one hour unless otherwise communicated\u2014for the installation of the AMI device. If you have a water-dependent device (e.g., water recirculation pump), you will need to turn it off before your upgrade to avoid possible damage. \u00a0 \u00a0 Clear a Path: \u00a0 Please trim any overgrown landscaping or move any large objects near your water meter box to provide easy installer access. \u00a0 Pro Tip: Upgrading your water meter may cause temporary air in your pipes and water discoloration. Your water remains safe and meets or surpasses all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. Please run water from a faucet without a screen for about 30 seconds to flush it out. Consider capturing this water for watering plants. \u00a0 WE\u2019LL NOTIFY YOU \u00a0 Check Your Mail\u00a0 Customers will receive a letter and email a few weeks in advance of your upgrade. \u00a0 Open Your Door\u00a0 Customers will receive a door hanger within 10 working days in advance of the work\u00a0 taking place and again once the work is completed.\u00a0 Go Online Visit ACWD.ORG/AMI for more information. Join us for a virtual community meeting on Nov. 16 at 6 p.m. to learn more about the AMI installation in your area. After installation, please share your feedback by taking a short, post-installation survey.\u00a0 ACWD began the AMI installation process in March 2021 and estimates each installation will take no longer than an hour. Full implementation in Fremont, Newark, and Union City will be complete by December 2023. The areas shown in blue on the above map have received AMI. \u00a0 MORE INSTALLATION DETAILS Our Team Our partners, Badger Meter and Professional Meters, Inc. (PMI) will upgrade or replace your water meter. We've also partnered with Utility Partners of America (UPA) to inspect our installations and ensure it meets our standards.\u00a0 \u00a0 Look for Our Team \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 Neon green ACWD/PMI uniforms and branded vehicles \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u2022 \u00a0 Installers will carry a badge and letter to authenticate their work on the project \u00a0 You may see one of our quality control technicians during or after the installation \u00a0 CDC Guidelines Followed COVID-19 safety guidelines will be followed. \u00a0 WHY AMI?

What is the purpose of the Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Program?     The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program is part of the Alameda County Water District\u2019s (District) commitment to delivering reliable drinking water supplies to more than 356,000 people living and working in Fremont, Newark and Union City. The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program will help improve water supply reliability for ACWD customers in the event of a major earthquake and will reduce service interruptions due to aging pipelines. Generally, pipelines have a lifespan of about 75 years, but the risk of a pipeline\u2019s failure increases in proportion with its age. With twenty percent of the District\u2019s pipelines installed before 1960, and the oldest pipelines placed underground in the 1940s, this project represents a major infrastructure improvement for more than 84,000 customers who depend upon reliable water supplies. Proactive pipeline upgrades protect the District and its customers from expensive fixes caused by leaks in the system.           2.   How can I stay up to date on the construction schedule?     The District is prioritizing construction sites in order of risk and project complexity within the overall program budget. Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.           3.   Why are the construction projects spread over multiple years?     All of ACWD\u2019s construction activities must comply with specific permit requirements and must take into account weather conditions and safety precautions. The staggered nature of the construction helps the District maintain reasonable working hours and reduce inconveniences to the public associated with very early and very late construction working hours.           4.   Who is paying for these projects?     The residents and businesses of Fremont, Newark, and Union City who, as ratepayers, contribute to these projects. We want to ensure our customers are aware of how their rate dollars are being used to improve water supply reliability and protect public health and safety. The costs for these projects are being funded in two ways: \u2022 Project costs have been factored into existing rate structures. \u2022 In 2012 ACWD successfully issued $45.2 million in Water Revenue Bonds to restructure existing debt at reduced interest rates and to help finance critical capital projects. By doing so, we are able to make investments in infrastructure while leveraging the District\u2019s excellent AAA bond rating and take advantage of historic low interest rates.           5.   How are you managing construction traffic?      The District is requiring its contractors to ensure that construction traffic is managed effectively and that truck traffic follows posted speed limits. We will have inspectors evaluating the project sites to ensure that rules are enforced and will address any issues that arise.           6.   How will you ensure safety at project sites during construction?     The District will ensure its contractors take precautions to ensure safety during construction, including installing barriers along construction routes, restricting travel speeds and implementing construction safety monitoring during all work. The District will provide project oversight and review during every stage of construction to ensure safety and design requirements are met, including the avoidance of gas lines and other pipelines. In the event of an emergency, the District will implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of surrounding residents, businesses and construction crews.           7.   Will the quality of the water delivered to my home be affected?     The District is committed to monitoring and ensuring water quality standards at all times. During construction, water pipelines may need to be temporarily isolated to accommodate improvements. This action may cause reverse flows in the pipeline, causing iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the pipeline to be stirred up, resulting in discolored water. However, water will remain safe to drink and continue to meet all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety.

What is the purpose of the projects along Alameda Creek?     The projects along Alameda Creek will allow steelhead trout and other threatened/endangered fish species to more easily and safely migrate upstream and downstream. At the same time, they will allow us to maintain reliable water supplies for residents and businesses in Fremont, Newark, and Union City.           2.   Why is ACWD concerned about fish in Alameda Creek?     Steelhead trout are a federally listed threatened species. Modifications to the Alameda Creek streambed and urbanization of the surrounding region have eliminated spawning areas and made it impossible for steelhead to migrate upstream. As a result, steelhead trout have been absent from Alameda Creek and its tributaries for several decades. Without implementing these projects, we would have to significantly curtail our groundwater recharge operations, limiting our ability to maintain reliable water supplies from Alameda Creek. \t\t\t         3.   How will these projects improve fish passage?     Threatened steelhead trout utilize Alameda Creek to migrate to/from the ocean on a journey that is an important part of our ecosystem. ACWD is working to enhance the migration conditions for steelhead trout by installing state-of-the-art fish screens and ladders.\t\t\t         4.   Who is involved?     ACWD is part of a regional effort focused on protecting the needs of threatened/endangered fish. Other partners include the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, Zone 7 Water Agency, East Bay Regional Park District, and Alameda County Public Works Agency, ACWD\u2019s efforts to improve steelhead passage through Alameda Creek represent a critical link in the greater Bay Area and northern California restoration efforts.\t\t\t         5.   When and where will construction take place?    ACWD\u2019s ongoing commitment to environmental and wildlife protection includes the construction of several projects along Alameda Creek. These projects span several years --- several projects have been completed with projects continuing into 2021. Up-to-date project locations and schedules can be found at: www.acwd.org/Fishway.   We will strive to limit construction hours to Monday-Friday between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m., but construction may also occur on Saturdays and Sundays or at night, as needed. We will post notices where construction will occur and provide advance notice of construction activities so that you can more easily plan your commute and trail use.            6.   What construction impacts can be expected?     Nearby residents, businesses, and commuters may experience typical construction impacts, such as noise, dust, heavy equipment, and visual impacts during construction hours. In addition, areas around construction sites may have limited access for periods of time in order to ensure safety and permitting compliance. Temporary traffic impacts may also be experienced as construction crews navigate equipment and manage construction routes. \t\t\t         7.   How will construction traffic be managed?     As equipment is moved in and out of construction sites, temporary slow traffic zones and monitored traffic safety measures will be implemented. Because safety is a top priority for ACWD, it may be necessary to temporarily close portions of the street to allow for access to/from project sites. We are committed to minimizing disruptions to residents and businesses and will post information online in advance of construction activities. \t\t\t         8.   Will the Alameda Creek Trail be closed during construction?      Alameda Creek Trail provides recreation to so many in the community and we will work to limit trail closures, when possible. The safety of trail users and their pets is a priority so there may be instances when closures occur as a safety precaution.  Trail closures are not planned during the RD3 Fishway project; however; certain areas along and adjacent to the Alameda Creek Trail, such as access from Rancho Arroyo Park to the creek, may be  temporarily impacted by construction projects occurring in 2019 \u2013 2021.   Construction notices will be posted online and along recreational trails and areas to advise you of impending closures and alternative routes.  All project schedules are available at www.acwd.org/Fishway           9.   Will dogs still be allowed in Shinn Meadow?     Recreational activities at Shinn Meadow may be impacted by the construction of projects scheduled in 2019 - 2021.  A temporary gated fence to provide for an enclosed off-leash dog area will be placed around Shinn Meadow, although the area may temporarily be closed for safety. We will utilize various media to advise you of current and upcoming construction activities.            10.   Will fishing be impacted at Quarry Lakes or Shinn Pond?     The fishing pier at Quarry Lakes will be temporarily closed only during the construction of projects scheduled in 2019 - 2021 to accommodate low water levels necessary for construction activities. Where fishing is currently allowed at Shinn Pond, shore access may be temporarily restricted during construction. Construction notices will be posted near recreational areas and online. \t\t\t         11.   What is the cost of these projects and how will they be funded?    ACWD will invest a total of $40 million for the combined projects in and along Alameda Creek. These projects will allow ACWD to continue operations of rubber dams and water diversion pipelines along the creek to recharge the Niles Cone Groundwater Basin in an environmentally friendly and sustainable manner, while still providing about 40 percent of the water supply to the communities of Fremont, Newark and Union City.  These projects are funded through grants, ACWD\u2019s Capital Improvement Program, and the Alameda County Flood Control District (ACFCD). ACFCD is partially funding the Rubber Dam No. 1/Flood Control Drop Structure Fish Ladder Project. \t\t\t         12.   What are the environmental impacts of this project?    Environmental impacts associated with the fish passage improvements have been evaluated and are addressed in an Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Public comments on the MND were accepted and carefully reviewed by ACWD throughout a 30-day public comment period. As the project continues, we will monitor the lakes and creek for impacts on wildlife as outlined in the MND. Although no long-term impacts to the environment are anticipated, a biologist will be onsite to monitor the construction activities for compliance with the MND. \t\t\t         13.   Why are the creek and pond levels so low, and how will this impact fish?     Spring 2013 represents the regions driest conditions on record. As a result, water levels in Grau and Snell Ponds (at Niles Community Park) are at historic lows.  At this time, ACWD is not operating any facilities in Alameda Creek. The current low flow conditions in the creek are a result of natural conditions. During dry years like this one, it is natural to see low water levels in local streams, ponds and lakes.  ACWD understands and shares the public\u2019s concerns expressed about the fate of the fish in the ponds and creek beds as they dry due to weather conditions. The District has been in contact with local fisheries biologists and the Department of Fish and Wildlife about this issue. Because the impacted fish are an invasive, non-native species not protected by the Fish and Game Code, the fish will not be relocated. Ongoing monitoring of the ponds and creek beds will continue in response to natural weather conditions.\t\t\t         14.   How can I get more information?     We are committed to notifying the public in advance of construction activities. Notices will be posted along recreational trails and areas, and construction schedules and staff contact information can be found online at www.acwd.org/Fishway. \t\t\t                         Live Edit                                      About ACWD           Construction Projects           Development Services           Fish Passage & Related Projects           Groundwater Resources           Help on Tap Program           Optional Service Line Coverage Plan           Rapid Alert Notification System           Transparency Information           Water Rates Process                                                     My Account and Service                  Pay My Bill                  Transparency Information                                                          Board of Directors                  Your Water                  Job Seekers                                                                                                                              Contact Us                 Mailing Address: Alameda County Water District 43885 S Grimmer Boulevard Fremont, CA 94538 Business Hours:\u00a0 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.\u00a0 Lobby Hours:\u00a0 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday - Friday (except holidays) Phone:  510-668-4200                                           Quick Links                 About ACWD's Conservation Program         Forms, Permits & Applications         Connect with Us         Services         Report Water Waste                     /QuickLinks.aspx                               Site Links                 Home         Site Map         Accessibility         Copyright Notices         Government Websites by CivicPlus\u00ae                     /QuickLinks.aspx                                                           For Water Emergencies Call:  510-668-6500                                                                                       Arrow Left         Arrow Right            []         Slideshow Left Arrow             Slideshow Right Arrow"}

Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.                 \u25bc  Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Project (MRSUP)\t\t         Show All Answers       1.   What is the purpose of the Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Program?     The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program is part of the Alameda County Water District\u2019s (District) commitment to delivering reliable drinking water supplies to more than 356,000 people living and working in Fremont, Newark and Union City. The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program will help improve water supply reliability for ACWD customers in the event of a major earthquake and will reduce service interruptions due to aging pipelines. Generally, pipelines have a lifespan of about 75 years, but the risk of a pipeline\u2019s failure increases in proportion with its age. With twenty percent of the District\u2019s pipelines installed before 1960, and the oldest pipelines placed underground in the 1940s, this project represents a major infrastructure improvement for more than 84,000 customers who depend upon reliable water supplies. Proactive pipeline upgrades protect the District and its customers from expensive fixes caused by leaks in the system.           2.   How can I stay up to date on the construction schedule?     The District is prioritizing construction sites in order of risk and project complexity within the overall program budget. Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.           3.   Why are the construction projects spread over multiple years?     All of ACWD\u2019s construction activities must comply with specific permit requirements and must take into account weather conditions and safety precautions. The staggered nature of the construction helps the District maintain reasonable working hours and reduce inconveniences to the public associated with very early and very late construction working hours.           4.   Who is paying for these projects?     The residents and businesses of Fremont, Newark, and Union City who, as ratepayers, contribute to these projects. We want to ensure our customers are aware of how their rate dollars are being used to improve water supply reliability and protect public health and safety. The costs for these projects are being funded in two ways: \u2022 Project costs have been factored into existing rate structures. \u2022 In 2012 ACWD successfully issued $45.2 million in Water Revenue Bonds to restructure existing debt at reduced interest rates and to help finance critical capital projects. By doing so, we are able to make investments in infrastructure while leveraging the District\u2019s excellent AAA bond rating and take advantage of historic low interest rates.           5.   How are you managing construction traffic?      The District is requiring its contractors to ensure that construction traffic is managed effectively and that truck traffic follows posted speed limits. We will have inspectors evaluating the project sites to ensure that rules are enforced and will address any issues that arise.           6.   How will you ensure safety at project sites during construction?     The District will ensure its contractors take precautions to ensure safety during construction, including installing barriers along construction routes, restricting travel speeds and implementing construction safety monitoring during all work. The District will provide project oversight and review during every stage of construction to ensure safety and design requirements are met, including the avoidance of gas lines and other pipelines. In the event of an emergency, the District will implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of surrounding residents, businesses and construction crews.           7.   Will the quality of the water delivered to my home be affected?     The District is committed to monitoring and ensuring water quality standards at all times. During construction, water pipelines may need to be temporarily isolated to accommodate improvements. This action may cause reverse flows in the pipeline, causing iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the pipeline to be stirred up, resulting in discolored water. However, water will remain safe to drink and continue to meet all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears. Please visit ACWD\u2019s website at www.acwd.org to learn how to flush the pipes in your home to remove the discoloration.

What is the purpose of the Main Replacement and Seismic Upgrade Program?     The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program is part of the Alameda County Water District\u2019s (District) commitment to delivering reliable drinking water supplies to more than 356,000 people living and working in Fremont, Newark and Union City. The Main Renewal and Seismic Upgrade Program will help improve water supply reliability for ACWD customers in the event of a major earthquake and will reduce service interruptions due to aging pipelines. Generally, pipelines have a lifespan of about 75 years, but the risk of a pipeline\u2019s failure increases in proportion with its age. With twenty percent of the District\u2019s pipelines installed before 1960, and the oldest pipelines placed underground in the 1940s, this project represents a major infrastructure improvement for more than 84,000 customers who depend upon reliable water supplies. Proactive pipeline upgrades protect the District and its customers from expensive fixes caused by leaks in the system.           2.   How can I stay up to date on the construction schedule?     The District is prioritizing construction sites in order of risk and project complexity within the overall program budget. Generally, pipelines that have the highest risk of failure in the event of a major earthquake will be prioritized and undergo construction first, as supplemented by smaller, generally less complex projects to meet program budgetary goals. An up-to-date construction schedule can be found online at www.acwd.org/MRSUP.           3.   Why are the construction projects spread over multiple years?     All of ACWD\u2019s construction activities must comply with specific permit requirements and must take into account weather conditions and safety precautions. The staggered nature of the construction helps the District maintain reasonable working hours and reduce inconveniences to the public associated with very early and very late construction working hours.           4.   Who is paying for these projects?     The residents and businesses of Fremont, Newark, and Union City who, as ratepayers, contribute to these projects. We want to ensure our customers are aware of how their rate dollars are being used to improve water supply reliability and protect public health and safety. The costs for these projects are being funded in two ways: \u2022 Project costs have been factored into existing rate structures. \u2022 In 2012 ACWD successfully issued $45.2 million in Water Revenue Bonds to restructure existing debt at reduced interest rates and to help finance critical capital projects. By doing so, we are able to make investments in infrastructure while leveraging the District\u2019s excellent AAA bond rating and take advantage of historic low interest rates.           5.   How are you managing construction traffic?      The District is requiring its contractors to ensure that construction traffic is managed effectively and that truck traffic follows posted speed limits. We will have inspectors evaluating the project sites to ensure that rules are enforced and will address any issues that arise.           6.   How will you ensure safety at project sites during construction?     The District will ensure its contractors take precautions to ensure safety during construction, including installing barriers along construction routes, restricting travel speeds and implementing construction safety monitoring during all work. The District will provide project oversight and review during every stage of construction to ensure safety and design requirements are met, including the avoidance of gas lines and other pipelines. In the event of an emergency, the District will implement appropriate measures to ensure the safety of surrounding residents, businesses and construction crews.           7.   Will the quality of the water delivered to my home be affected?     The District is committed to monitoring and ensuring water quality standards at all times. During construction, water pipelines may need to be temporarily isolated to accommodate improvements. This action may cause reverse flows in the pipeline, causing iron and manganese sediment lying on the bottom of the pipeline to be stirred up, resulting in discolored water. However, water will remain safe to drink and continue to meet all state and federal drinking water standards for public health and safety. If your drinking water becomes discolored, avoid using your washing machine and dishwasher until the water clears.

Home About Us Water Quality Main Cleaning How the Main Cleaning Program Works                         How the Main Cleaning Program Works\t\t               ACWD cleans water mains to remove the buildup in pipes that may cause discolored water. This is accomplished by opening fire hydrants. As the water flows at high velocities through the mains, scale and fine sediment are dislodged. The resulting discolored water leaves the distribution system through the open fire hydrants. Since some of this water eventually flows into San Francisco Bay, ACWD utilizes disinfectant and sediment removal best management practices to minimize impacts to the environment. Main cleaning may result in a brief period of discolored tap water for some Tri-City residents from January-June. Despite its appearance, the water remains safe for household uses such as drinking and cooking. ACWD recommends minimizing water use and avoid washing light-colored laundry from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM on the day or week main cleaning is scheduled for your neighborhood.\u00a0 \u00a0 For additional information, please visit  acwd.org/maincleaning  or contact the Operations Department administrative group at (510) 668-6500, Monday through Friday, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Evaluation of Recapture Options Prior to resuming the main cleaning program this year, ACWD staff thoroughly examined possible recapture methods for the main cleaning discharges and will continue to do so. As much as ACWD would like to be able to reuse water from the main cleaning program, unfortunately, in most cases, it's just not technically feasible. To clean our mains and continue to ensure high quality water for our customers, we need to flush at remarkably high flow rates that are not possible to recapture. The number of trucks, transit time for the trucks, gas, etc. needed to recapture the water would be excessive. Directing the water to a truck would be very time-consuming and resource intensive, significantly increasing costs of the State-required processes.

This is part of the vital service provided by ACWD to ensure that all customers receive high quality water. Cleaning will occur from January 2024 through June 2024; Monday through Friday, 7 AM to 4 PM (excluding holidays). \u00a0Note that the cleaning schedule is subject to change.\u00a0 Please note  that there may be sediments stirred up in the water during or immediately after the cleaning event, giving the water a cloudy or discolored appearance. The water continues to meet all state and federal Drinking Water Standards for public health and safety (see  discolored water FAQs ). Residents may experience discolored water on streets or cul-de-sacs if the surrounding areas are being cleaned. Despite its appearance, discolored water does not indicate that the integrity of the water main has been compromised. A disinfectant residual is always maintained to ensure that the water continues to meet all state and federal health-based Drinking Water Standards. Some people may be more vulnerable to contaminants in drinking water than the general population such as immunocompromised persons, some elderly, and infants. These people should seek advice about drinking water from their health care providers.\u00a0 Please minimize water use and avoid washing light-colored laundry from 7 AM to 4 PM on the day main cleaning is scheduled or if discolored water is noticed.

Helpful Tips for Home: To minimize discolored water: Refrain from water use while main cleaning is in progress in your neighborhood. Wait an hour after street operations have ceased before using your taps to let normal flow patterns re-establish themselves. To clear discolored water from your plumbing: Run the cold water faucet of your bathtub or other unscreened tap for 2-3 minutes until the water runs clear. If the water does not clear, turn off your faucet and wait an hour before repeating the process.

If you are experiencing any symptoms of illness, the District recommends that you contact your personal physician. Basic Understandings Below are basic considerations that will help you with troubleshooting a water quality issue. Does the problem occur at some or all inside taps? Do you observe the same conditions at the outside front faucet (hose bib)? Does it occur with just the cold water, the hot water, or both? Does it occur only when you first turn on the water or does it occur continuously? When did you first notice the issue? Are your neighbors experiencing the same issue? Do you know what type of pipes you have (i.e., copper, galvanized iron)? Do you have any in-home water treatment devices (i.e., water softener, reverse osmosis system, whole house filtration system, point-of-use activated carbon filter)? If not in use, is it still connected to your internal plumbing? Index                              Color or Appearance of Water Cloudy, Foamy, or Milky Water Brown or Yellow Hot Water On First Draw Brown or Yellow Cold Water Constantly Blue Color Green Color Purging Discolored Water Floating Particles Black Particles Brown or Orange Particles White Particles Crystals or White Residue                  Taste Odor Chemical / Medicinal Odor Chlorine Odor Foul / Sulfur / Rotten Egg / Sewage Odor Swampy / Fishy / Earthy / Musty / Moldy / Grassy Odor Gasoline, Turpentine, or Organic Solvent Odor                        Color or Appearance of Water Cloudy, Foamy, or Milky Water If you are constantly experiencing cloudiness in both the cold and hot water, the cloudiness is caused by tiny air bubbles. This air is under pressure in your water pipes, much like carbon dioxide in a bottle of soda. When you turn on your tap, the pressure is released, allowing the bubbles to appear, just as removing the cap from a soda bottle causes the soda to fizz. If you allow a glass of water to stand for a few moments, the air bubbles will rise to the surface. This phenomenon is called entrained air and does not affect the quality of your water. The water is perfectly safe to drink. ( Return to top )  Brown or Yellow Hot Water On First Draw The internal plumbing of your house is the likely culprit if discolored water appears only for a minute or two after you turn on the tap. Many houses have galvanized iron pipe, and when the zinc coating on the inside of galvanized iron pipe wears thin, the water becomes discolored as it comes in contact with bare iron. The longer the water sits in the pipes, the worse the discoloration will be. That is why this problem is most noticeable the first time you turn on the tap in the morning. If only a few taps are affected, only a portion of your internal plumbing has galvanized pipe. After running your tap for a few minutes, clean water from your water heater or the water main will replace the discolored water. Since iron is an essential nutrient, this condition poses no health hazard. If the discoloration bothers you, however, flush the tap until the water becomes clear and save the water for iron-loving plants. ( Return to top )  Brown or Yellow Cold Water Constantly Light yellow to dark brown water is typically caused by a disturbance of pipeline sediments in the water main. The discoloration is caused by dissolved iron which is stirred up in naturally-occurring sediments that exist in all water systems. Any of the following circumstances may have caused flow reversals in the water mains and sediment to be disturbed. The different colors can be attributed to varying chemical oxidation states of the iron (or rust) and by varying concentrations of the rust in the water. The discolored water may be due to planned cleaning of the water main to remove pipeline sediments in your area. A nearby water hydrant may have been knocked over due to a vehicle collision or may be in use to fight a fire. There may be some pipeline repair work (or construction activity) in the area and some valves may have been closed for this work. Despite its appearance, this does not indicate that the water is unsafe or that the integrity of the water main has been compromised. A disinfectant residual is maintained at all times to ensure that the water is safe for household use, including cooking and drinking. For aesthetic reasons, you should avoid doing laundry until the water clears up. ( Return to top )  Blue Color Having blue water is rare. The blue disinfectant you use in your toilet can cause discoloration of your tap water. If your water supply was recently turned off, a condition may have been created in which water from the toilet tank was siphoned into the plumbing of your house. These disinfectants contain chemicals that may pose health hazards if ingested or touched. Flush your plumbing by opening each tap until the water runs clear. \u00a0Do not drink this water.\u00a0 Blue (or blue-green) water may be due to extreme copper plumbing corrosion, which is also a rare circumstance. If this is happening, the water will usually have a bluish-green tint and/or will leave a bluish-green stain around fixtures and on a white surface if the water drips from a faucet. This copper corrosion can be caused by your electrical system being grounded to your water pipes, especially if you have a mixture of pipe material (i.e, some copper and some galvanized iron). ( Return to top )  Green Color Standing water, such as in a white bathtub, will sometimes appear to have a greenish cast to it. Fluorescent lights will make your water appear green. To test this, fill a white bucket with water and take it outside. In the sunlight, the water will look clear and no longer appear green. ( Return to top )  Purging Discolored Water Wait an hour before resuming normal water use to let normal flow patterns re-establish themselves and any remaining sediment to settle down. Flush water at full force from your front hose bib until it runs clear. This should take no more than two or three minutes. If the water continues to be discolored, wait an additional hour and try again before proceeding to the next step. Start by flushing the cold water faucet in the bathtub. If you are concerned about wasting water, water the backyard from the backyard hose bib for several minutes or until the water clears. After the tub or backyard faucet runs clear, flush all of the other cold water household faucets (starting from the side of the house nearest the street, then the rest of the cold water faucets within the home). If discolored water has been drawn into the hot water system, the hot water can continue to be used until the discoloration dissipates and is no longer an aesthetic issue. This is generally preferred to draining and refilling the water heater which may require expert help (calling a plumber) if you are unfamiliar on how to do this safely. Following this guidance generally will take care of the problem. However, depending on the pattern of water use in your neighborhood, it may be necessary to repeat the process more than once if the discoloration continues. If the discoloration persists for more than a day, call ACWD at 510-668-6500. ( Return to top )  Floating Particles Black Particles Black particles can come from three common sources: a broken water filter, a degrading faucet washer or gasket, or a disintegrating black rubber flexible supply line hose (for a water heater, washing machine, or kitchen faucet, etc.). If the particles are very hard, similar in size and shape, and look like large coffee grounds, they are probably granular activated carbon (GAC) particles from the inside of a GAC water filter that you have installed. Replace the filter cartridge or consult with the manufacturer or the vendor who sold it to you. If the particles are solid but rubbery in texture, they could be pieces of an old disintegrating faucet washer or gasket. If this is the problem, the particles would likely only be present at one faucet and that faucet is already leaking. Replace the faucet washers and the packing at the ends of the supply lines. If the particles are small black particles that can be easily smeared between two fingers, they are probably from the inside of a flexible hose. These black rubber hoses are covered with a braided stainless steel mesh. Over time, the chloramine in the water causes the rubber to break down. Replace the hose, ideally with a liner that is identified as chemical or chloramine resistant. Black rubber hoses typically have a one-year warranty while the more chemical resistant hoses have a five-year warranty. ( Return to top )  Brown or Orange Particles Brown or orange particles are typically rust particles that have broken off the inside of your water pipes or the ACWD water mains. These particles are very hard, irregular in size and shape, and can be several different colors (including black). They consist of mostly iron and are not a health hazard but they are a nuisance if they clog washing machine screens, shower heads, or faucet aerators. Another common cause of brown or orange particles in the water is a broken water softener. A water softener contains many small, round beads (or resin) for softening water. The beads will be uniform in size, typically the size of fish eggs, and are brown or orange. The mechanism that keeps these beads in the tank can break, releasing them into your water. Call your service agent for repairs. ( Return to top )  White Particles White or tan particles in the water usually come from internal plumbing. This material is pipe scale and is a combination of calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate. Calcium and magnesium carbonates are naturally occurring minerals and are not a health hazard. Over time, these minerals can deposit on the inside of your pipes and then begin to flake off. Although this process usually occurs slowly over a long period of time, there are three common circumstances that can cause it to happen rapidly: If your water was turned off for repair work, the pressure and turbulence created when it is turned back on can dislodge the minerals from the pipes If you install a water softener, the softer water can begin to re-dissolve the minerals from the pipes and pieces may begin to break loose If you have galvanized iron pipes, they will corrode over time and gradually swell up on the inside, causing the minerals to flake off (Although pipe scale is not a health hazard, it can clog washing machine screens, shower heads, and faucet aerators. There is no practical way to remove pipe scale from the inside of your pipes; if the problem is severe, you may want to consider re-plumbing.) The water heater is another source for white or tan particles. As the water is heated, calcium and magnesium carbonates precipitate out of the water, forming white or tan sand-like deposits. As you use the hot water, these minerals can be carried along clogging washing machine screens, shower heads, and faucet aerators. To keep mineral deposits from accumulating in the water heater, flush your water heater at least once a year. Flushing regularly also extends the life of the heater and makes it operate more fuel efficiently. Instructions for flushing can be found in the Water Quality FAQ on hardness. If you are experiencing floating white particles, the water heater is the likely culprit. A water heater contains a plastic dip tube, which is an extension to the inlet of the water supply. The tube directs the cold incoming water to the bottom of the tank. As the tube gets old, it can disintegrate, sending white particles into the hot water. These particles are brittle and vary in size from small irregular pebbles to longer shards. Contact the manufacturer or vendor for advice on how best to repair the water heater. ( Return to top )  Crystals or White Residue The crystals or sediment left behind on fixtures, white surfaces, and pots after water evaporates are calcium and magnesium carbonates. These are naturally occurring minerals and do not pose a health hazard. These deposits may appear green, blue, or brown, having been colored by tiny amounts of the metals found in your water pipes. Carbonate deposits can be dissolved with white vinegar. Dishwasher deposits can be minimized by using a commercial conditioner, by using liquid detergents and by using the air-dry instead of the power-dry setting on your dishwasher, which bakes the carbonates onto glassware. ( Return to top )  Taste If you recently moved to the ACWD service area, your new water may taste different to you. Just as various brands of bottled water taste different due to the varying minerals they contain, the taste of domestic drinking water also varies with its source(s). Over time, you will become accustomed to its taste. Be assured that the drinking water that ACWD provides meets or surpasses all State and federal drinking water standards. ( Return to top )  Odor The first step in understanding the source of an odor is to determine if the problem exists in the public water supply or in your plumbing. If the water supply is causing the odor, you will experience the odor at every water faucet and it will be persistent. If the source of the odor is in your plumbing, you will experience the odor in only one or several, but not all, of the faucets. If the problem goes away after running the water for a few minutes, the cause is somewhere in your plumbing. If your plumbing is the source of the odor, you can try flush the plumbing system or you can consult a licensed plumber. Contact ACWD at 510-668-6500 if you suspect the public water supply. When you detect an odor in your tap water, we recommend that you perform what we calla glass test at the faucet where you detect the odor. Run the cold water tap for 20 to 30 seconds Get a clean glass Fill and rinse twice with cold tap water. Fill the glass and turn off the faucet Step away from the sink (This eliminates the possibility of mistaking odors from your drain for odors in your water.) Smell the water in the glass and characterize the odor, if any ( Return to top )  Chemical / Medicinal Odor If the odor is medicinal, it is most likely the chloramine (also called total chlorine) that ACWD uses to disinfect the water to ensure that it is safe to drink. ( Return to top )  Chlorine Odor If you detect a chlorine odor, it is most likely the chloramine (also called total chlorine) that ACWD uses to disinfect the water to ensure that it is safe to drink. Although the total chlorine level is a fraction of what is found in pools and spas, you may occasionally detect the smell of chlorine in your water. This odor may be particularly strong in the shower since chlorine is released to the air more rapidly when mixed with hot water. ( Return to top )  Foul / Sulfur / Rotten Egg / Sewage Odor Cold Water:  If the odor is not evident in the glass, but is noticeable when the cold water is running and you are standing at the sink, then the odor is most likely coming from the drain. This problem is easily solved by filling the sink with hot water, adding a few ounces of chlorine bleach, and allowing the hot chlorinated water to flush and disinfect the drain. It is also good practice to periodically remove and clean the sin stopper. The garbage disposal in the kitchen sink can be cleaned in a similar manner. Hot Water: If you find these odors in your hot water, there are two probable causes: Bacteria may be residing in the water heater. Disinfecting the water heater may eliminate this odor. Instructions on how to do this can be found in the Water Quality FAQ for hardness. The water heater anode may need to be replaced. If experienced, inspect the anode yourself; otherwise, call a plumber. ( Return to top )  Swampy / Fishy / Earthy / Musty / Moldy / Grassy Odor These odors may be caused by an algae bloom in a water source reservoir. Typically this is a short-lived event. Contact ACWD if you would like more information. ( Return to top )  Gasoline, Turpentine, or Organic Solvent Odor If you smell gasoline or an organic solvent odor in the cold water, call ACWD at 510-668-6500 immediately for further assistance. This problem is rare and potentially serious. Do not use the water.\u00a0 It is possible that your meter box was exposed to a hazardous substance.

February 10th, 2022 Board Meeting At this meeting, the Board conducted a public hearing on the proposed increases to water rates, water shortage emergency stage rates, fire service line rates, and the miscellaneous fees and charges, including updates to the facilities connection charges. The Board received public comments, and after deliberation voted to adopt the rate proposal.  You may view the meeting on YouTube by using this link.   You may also view the presentation from the February meeting. Financial Workshops In 2021, the District conducted a series of Financial Workshops.\u00a0 May 19, 2021 : At this workshop, District staff presented the draft Proposed FY 2021/22 and FY 2022/23 Budget to the Board. The Board reviewed forecast revenue, operating expenses, capital improvement program expenditures, staffing levels and labor-related costs, and financial planning scenarios related to water conservation.  View the presentation from the May 19, 2021 workshop. May 27, 2021:  This workshop continued the discussion on the District 2-year budget with the focus primarily on capital expenditures and multi-year financial scenarios, including water rates, related to water conservation.  View the presentation from the May 27, 2021 workshop. August 26, 2021:  This workshop focused on the District\u2019s financial status, rate setting requirements including a cost-of-service analysis, the allocation between fixed and variable charges, the charges for dedicated fire service lines, water shortage emergency stage rates, and the use of the property tax roll for billing and collecting on delinquent accounts.  View the presentation from the August 26 workshop. September 23, 2021:  This workshop included follow-up from the August 26 workshop, continue the discussion regarding the alternative stage rate scenarios and a cost of service analysis, reinstatement of formal collections activities including use of the property tax roll, and use of property tax roll to collect service charges.  View the presentation from the September 23 workshop. October 28, 2021:  This workshop focused on the discussion regarding the revenue allocation between the fixed and variable charges, the approaches to revenue adjustments, as well as a review of related data and policy objective considerations. Following Board deliberation, the Board considered a rate increase based on a 6% revenue increase to the fixed service charge and no change to the commodity charge. As a separate item, this workshop also discussed the transition from at-large to zone-based elections, which is included in the presentation materials along with the financial presentation.  View the presentation from the October 28 workshop. 2020 Water Rates Process In 2020 ACWD completed a new rates process, with the Board ultimately declining to increase water rates. This process also included a series of workshops and Board meetings. Financial Workshops August 27, 2020 : The District held a financial workshop to start a new rates process to review the allocation between fixed service charges and commodity charges in collecting revenues, the charges for dedicated fire service lines, and to provide an update on the District\u2019s current financial status.  View the presentation from the August 20 workshop . October 22, 2020:\u00a0 The District held a financial \u00a0workshop to continue the discussion regarding the District\u2019s current and projected future financial status and potential water rates and charges increase. The workshop was conducted by webinar. Customers were invited to participate virtually to join the discussion and to learn more about the District\u2019s finances, rates and charges, as well as the cost-of-service studies that the District is conducting to guide the rate setting process.  View the agenda and presentation from the October 22 workshop. \u00a0 Board Meetings: Following Board deliberation at workshops in August and October, District staff prepared a water rates proposal with a 2 percent increase effective March 1, 2021 and another 2 percent increase effective March 1, 2022. After deliberation in the December 10th Board meeting, the Board determined not to move forward with a rate increase. Additional Documents The full report on the water rates proposal from the District's financial consultant is available.

These are a few ways ACWD is leading the way in using water wisely: Installation of a ReScape Rated  Demonstration Garden  located in front of the ACWD headquarters and available for all customers to visit. Visitors can enjoy a self-guided tour supported by interpretive signage throughout the garden.\u00a0 Dry sweeping methods or a blower is used \u00a0to remove debris from pavement and walkways located at ACWD facilities  instead of pressure washing . Fleet vehicles are washed at a commercial car wash that recycles water. Drought tolerant landscaping is standard at all ACWD facilities.  Did you know that ACWD customers can receive a rebate for replacing lawns with water-efficient landscapes?\u00a0 Please visit  ACWD's Rebate Page  for more information. ACWD staff are certified landscape professionals with earned credentials from Qualified Water-Efficient Landscaper (QWEL) and ReScape (previously Bay-Friendly).  Learn more  about becoming QWEL certified. Before irrigation season, surveys are conducted on all facilities to find and fix outdoor leaks and avoid water waste from overspray, broken sprinkler heads, and broken pipes. Smart irrigation controllers that rely on real-time weather information and other water-efficient technology are installed at District facilities.  Did you know that ACWD customers can receive a rebate for switching to smart irrigation?  Please visit  ACWD's Rebate Page  for more information. Water-efficient fixtures are installed at all ACWD facilities.  Did you know that ACWD customers can receive free water-efficient devices?\u00a0 Request your water-efficient devices. Modified the 2022 Main Cleaning Program (flushing) to include only dead-end mains, blow offs, and select areas that were identified as critical for water quality purposes. \u00a0This modification should result in approximately a 50% reduction in water used from the Main Cleaning Program in typical non-drought years. For more information visit  ACWD's Main Cleaning Program Page .\u00a0 Suspended routine fire hydrant flow testing.\u00a0 Making Conservation a California Way of Life In 2018, then Governor Jerry Brown passed two landmark water conservation bills,  AB 1668  and  SB 606 . Together they make up a framework called, \u201cMaking Water Conservation a California Way of Life.\u201d Urban water suppliers, like ACWD, will be required to stay within annual water budgets, based on the implementation of this framework at a service area-wide level (not on an individual customer basis). ACWD has been tracking the legislation to ensure compliance in 2023. To learn more about the framework,  click here . Please join us in using water wisely this year!

The WEMP provides a roadmap for ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Program for the next five years (to 2025) and strategies out to 2050.\u00a0 Final\u00a0 Water Efficiency Master Plan  - as presented to the ACWD Board on April 13, 2021 ACWD initiated the WEMP development process in 2019 after a WEMP was identified as a means to achieve Strategic Goal 2: Sustain a reliable, high-quality water supply for District customers in  ACWD\u2019s 2018 Five-Year Strategic Plan . The Strategic Plan stated that ACWD should \u201cdevelop and implement a Water Efficiency Master Plan to leverage the benefits of Advanced Metering Infrastructure and address changing water use efficiency regulations,\u201d and provide baseline analysis for future water supply planning documents.\u00a0 Several workshops and meetings were held between July 2019 and October 2020. The District\u2019s Board of Directors provided guidance and priorities for developing water use efficiency strategies and laying a foundation for meeting long-term water supply needs. There was also a  Community Survey  conducted in 2019 regarding conservation measures and conservation interests.\u00a0 The WEMP report documents the planning process, summarizes the analysis, describes various water use efficiency strategies along with their anticipated costs, savings, and cost-effectiveness, and recommends a five-year strategy for ACWD\u2019s Water Use Efficiency Program that:\u00a0 Provides a cost-effective means to address water demands in the short term with a foundation for establishing water use efficiency goals out to 2050. Expands existing efforts to meet state-mandated targets and aggregate water use objectives. Improves accessibility of water use efficiency services for lower income customers in ACWD\u2019s service area. Integrates well with  ACWD\u2019s Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) project. Supports customer interests and takes advantage of regional partnerships.
